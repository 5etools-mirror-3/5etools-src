Consider granting the characters advantage on any ability check they make to communicate with a creature if they offer something it wants. The \"{@area Monsters' Desires|377|x}\" section below suggest things that a creature might like, depending on its type.",{"type":"image","href":{"type":"internal","path":"book/TCE/095-04-006.webp"},"title":"Adventurers offer meat to an owlbear.","width":1200,"height":800,"credit":"Robin Olausson"},{"type":"entries","name":"Monster Research","page":148,"entries":["Adventurers can research what a creature is likely to desire.
