On the sugared paper, unfold the puff pastry (which should be rectangular) and, if it is less than 15 inches long, place a second parchment sheet over it and use a rolling pin to gently roll it to that length (taking care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing their puff when baked).

				"The dimensions of puff pastry sheets vary by brand, so depending on which one you use, you may or may not have to roll it to the required length. Regardless, make sure your pastry is completely thawed, so you can unfold it initially, and roll it up with the filling, without it cracking. It should still be cool, though, because warm puff pastry can become sticky. Finally, don't allow the baked buns to cool completely in the muffin tin, or they will stick to the cups.",
				"All that said, don't allow all this information daunt you. The buns are, in fact, easy to form and bake, and easier yet to eat. On that note, they're best within a couple of hours of baking. You can, however, re-crisp them with about a 5-minute stay in a 350°F oven."

Set a roasting rack in the roasting pan and cover that with foil, shiny-side up, leaving overhangs sufficient to fully wrap the ham once it's on the rack.

Bake until the ham registers about 120°F on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 3½ hours.",

Peel back the foil and, working carefully with the hot ham, pour as much of the accumulated ham juices as possible into a large measuring cup or bowl and set aside. Brush half the pineapple juice mixture evenly over the exposed surfaces of the ham (don't worry about the cut side). Leaving the foil open, bake until glossy and beginning to caramelize, about 15 minutes. Brush the remaining mixture over the ham and continue baking, again until glossy and caramelized, about 8 minutes more.",
				"Remove the ham from the oven and again working carefully, pour as much of the accumulated ham juices as possible into the bowl with the first batch (you may have as much as 1½ cups) and set aside. Fold the foil back up over the ham to tent loosely and let rest for 15 minutes.",
				"In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the shallot softens, about 2 minutes. Add the ⅔ cup reserved reduced pineapple juice, the remaining ¼ cup honey, and remaining 1 tablespoon mustard. Whisk to combine and bring to a simmer, about 2 minutes.",
				"In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk the cornstarch and ⅔ cup of the reserved ham juices until uniform. Add to the saucepan and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute. Add the chopped pineapple and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, to heat the sauce through, 1 to 2 minutes more. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Carve the ham and serve with the warm sauce."

Scrape the mixture into the pan, stir to combine thoroughly, and partially cover the pan. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan occasionally, until the stew is thickened, 15 to 25 minutes longer. Remove the bay leaves if desired, add about ⅓ cup parsley, and stir to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Divide the sornstag among individual bowls, sprinkle each with a few of the reserved toasted almonds and some parsley. Serve immediately."

Coat a flexible spatula with nonstick cooking spray and scrape the dough into the greased baking pan. Flour your hands generously and pat the dough into an even layer, making sure to push it into the corners and to the edges. Clean and coat the spatula again, if necessary, and score the dough into nine equal squares (two cuts in each direction, dividing the dough into three rows in each direction), reaching to the bottom of the pan as you score.",

Cut the remaining 1 tablespoon room-temperature butter into ½-inch pieces, put them on the surface of the biscuits, wait a moment for them to begin melting, and use a brush or the spatula to spread evenly over the biscuits. Cool the biscuits for about 12 minutes more, pull them apart, and serve warm.",
