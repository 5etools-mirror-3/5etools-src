Add the thinly sliced leeks, bay leaves, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the leeks are softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes more. Add the sherry and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Continue to simmer, stirring, until the liquid is thickened and slightly reduced, about 1 minute more. Gradually add the broth, stirring vigorously to incorporate it smoothly.",

Remove the bay leaves from the pot, add the shredded chicken, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper; stir to mix. Over medium-high heat, return to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.",

In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butter and olive oil (or reserved chicken fat, if you have any), stopping to swirl occasionally, to melt the butter. Add the milk and continue to microwave on high until the mixture is just warm (do not overheat), about 1½ minutes. Add the warmed milk mixture to the flour mixture. With a wooden spoon or fork, mix until incorporated and uniformly moist (the mixture should look like a wet, shaggy dough).",

Using a soup spoon, drop twelve golf ball\u2013size portions of dumpling dough into the pot, placing them about ½ inch apart (drop eight around the perimeter and four in the center). Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook undisturbed until the dumplings are puffed and cooked through, and a toothpick inserted into them comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.",

On the sugared paper, unfold the puff pastry (which should be rectangular) and, if it is less than 15 inches long, place a second parchment sheet over it and use a rolling pin to gently roll it to that length (taking care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing their puff when baked).

			"noteCook": [
				"The dimensions of puff pastry sheets vary by brand, so depending on which one you use, you may or may not have to roll it to the required length. Regardless, make sure your pastry is completely thawed, so you can unfold it initially, and roll it up with the filling, without it cracking. It should still be cool, though, because warm puff pastry can become sticky. Finally, don't allow the baked buns to cool completely in the muffin tin, or they will stick to the cups.",
				"All that said, don't allow all this information daunt you. The buns are, in fact, easy to form and bake, and easier yet to eat. On that note, they're best within a couple of hours of baking. You can, however, re-crisp them with about a 5-minute stay in a 350°F oven."

Press out any trapped air, press the edges firmly to seal, and, using a fork, crimp the edges for decoration and to secure the seal. Repeat with the remaining pastry rounds and filling, and transfer onto the prepared baking sheets.",
				"In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each marruth with the mixture. Bake until the marruths are light golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks halfway through the baking. Set the baking sheets on wire racks, cool the pastries for about 5 minutes, and serve hot."

Instead of being packed in oil or salt, the anchovies are marinated in vinegar, which gives them a piquant flavor and whitens the flesh. They're less salty and intense than their tinned, oil-packed brethren.",

Allow any excess batter to drip off, then slip them into the oil and fry until slightly puffed and pale gold, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 390°F, stirring to prevent sticking, and turning the pieces over in the oil once or twice to promote even frying, 5 to 6 minutes for each batch. With a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the tempura to the paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle lightly with salt and place on the wire rack set on the baking sheet and put in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to recover to 390°F and fry the remaining batches. Serve with the sweet and sour sauce."

Place the balls on a plate and rest them (to firm up and dry out slightly) for 45 minutes. The balls will keep, stored in an airtight container at room temperature, for about 3 days."

				"In a medium skillet over medium heat, toast the coconut, stirring constantly, until many of the flakes are dark golden brown (some flakes will remain white, so the quantity will appear to be spotty brown), about 4 minutes. Immediately scrape the coconut into the bowl of a food processor, and set aside to cool to room temperature, at least 10 minutes. Pulse until it's about the texture of whole flax seeds (a little smaller than sunflower seeds), about five 2-second pulses, and set aside.",
				"Meanwhile, carefully wipe out the still-hot skillet. In the skillet, off heat, whisk ¼ cup of the flour and ½ cup of the water until it forms a smooth, thick paste (with help from the residual heat in the skillet) about the texture of mashed potatoes, about 1 minute. Immediately scrape the paste into the bowl of a stand mixer, and set aside to cool until tepid, about 8 minutes.",
				"Meanwhile, with a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds from all six halves. Collect the seeds in a small dish, cover, and set aside.",
				"Add the milk to the flour paste and whisk until smooth. Add one egg and whisk to incorporate it. Add the remaining 2¼ cups flour and the yeast. Fit the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and mix on low speed for 1 minute. Adjust the speed to medium-low and continue mixing until the flour is incorporated and the resulting mass is cohesive, about 30 seconds longer. Turn off the mixer and rest the dough for 15 minutes. Add the sugar and 1½ teaspoons salt and knead on medium-low speed for 5 minutes, until the dough appears smoother. With the mixer running, add one piece of the butter and continue mixing until it is incorporated fully into the dough, about 30 seconds, before adding the next. Repeat to add and incorporate the remaining three pieces of butter, adding the vanilla seeds along with the last piece. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, adding the coconut midway through that time and stopping when needed to scrape down the dough hook and sides of the bowl (the dough will be quite soft and sticky).",
				"Flour a work surface very lightly, scrape the dough from the bowl to the surface, and knead it briefly to form a ball. Lightly oil a medium bowl, add the dough, and turn it to coat very lightly with the oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the dough has become puffy and its volume has increased by three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.",
				"Oil a 9-inch round cake pan, line the bottom with parchment paper, and oil the parchment paper. Transfer the dough to the work surface, gently deflate it, and press and stretch it into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle with a short side facing you. Cut the dough lengthwise into 4 equal strips and cut each strip crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, stretch and press the dough gently to form an 8 by 2-inch strip. Starting on a short side, roll the strip to form a snug cylinder. Arrange the shaped buns seam-side down in the prepared pan, placing 10 buns around the edge of the pan, pointing inward, and the remaining 2 buns in the center. Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the buns appear puffy and their volume has increased by about three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.",
				"When ready to bake, with a rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 375°F. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water. Gently brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash (take care not to deflate the dough) and bake until deep golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Set the pan on a cooling rack and cool for about 15 minutes. Gently loosen the edges of the buns with your fingers and gently pry them out of the pan. Cool the buns until just warm or room temperature, remove the parchment from the bottom of the buns if necessary, and serve. Leftover buns can be wrapped tightly and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days."

				"When toasting the coconut, keep it moving in the skillet, and keep a close eye on it because it browns quickly once it begins and can burn easily. As soon as the coconut is browned to your liking, get it out of the hot skillet immediately.",
				"The dough is quite soft and sticky, so a bowl scraper, ideally a flexible one, is very helpful for scraping it out of the mixer bowl (and off the dough hook) and forming the ball on the work surface prior to the first rise."
