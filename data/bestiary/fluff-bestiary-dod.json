						"Yarnspinner has a monstrous form resembling that of an enormous spider. However, he has a benevolent personality and is obsessed with stories. In fact, he has amassed quite a collection of storybooks, which he keeps in silk sacks for easy transport. When Yarnspinner dreams, he projects a harmless, ghost-like version of himself that wanders his domain. In this form, he can talk to strangers and steer them one direction or another without fear of being harmed. If a visitor needs a safe haven, Yarnspinner is more than happy to fashion a hut made of spider silk for his guest to inhabit. The visitor is free to remain there as long as they wish, provided they do no harm to the other denizens of Fablerise.",
						"Yarnspinner's favorite activity is to read stories aloud to the animals that occupy his domain, all of which benefit from having had {@spell awaken} spells cast on them. The archfey's stories attract quite a gathering and are the talk of Fablerise's awakened animal kingdom."

A mushroom circle in the heart of the domain serves as a fey crossing, and one can travel more quickly through the thicket by whistling a tune while walking backward."
