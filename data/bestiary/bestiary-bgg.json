The limb has the statistics of a troll amalgam, except for the following: it is Medium, it has 45 hit points, its speed is 30 ft., it doesn't have a challenge rating or Legendary Resistance, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, which it can use only to grapple.",

If the limb is not destroyed within 24 hours of being flung, roll a {@dice d12}; on a roll of 12, the limb regenerates into a troll (see the Monster Manual). Otherwise, the limb withers away."
