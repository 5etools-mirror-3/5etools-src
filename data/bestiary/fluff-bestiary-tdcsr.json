Others have been elected to the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}, shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.",
						"Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the {@table Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence}, whose power they unlocked in the battles against the {@book Cinder King|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King} and {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}, are still within their grasp.",
						"The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina\u2014hopefully as an ally or a \"quest giver,\" for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run."
