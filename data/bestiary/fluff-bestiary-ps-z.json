				"The various forms of undead ghosts are the incorporeal remnants of life and personality left after the death of a mortal body. But sometimes the reverse is true: a body retains its animation and hunger while losing any trace of its soul, becoming a zombie. When a vampire who is not a bloodchief drains the blood from a living humanoid, that creature undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a stronger, faster version of a {@creature zombie} called a null. Nulls' heads are featureless except for a gaping mouth filled with jagged teeth. Their bodies are shriveled and distorted, but preternaturally strong. They are mindlessly loyal servants to the vampire nobility, and the number of nulls under a vampire's control is a mark of status and power among the vampire houses of Guul Draz."

				"The wurms of Zendikar are gigantic creatures with features akin to both snakes and insects. A wurm's serpentine body is covered in heavy bands of scales, giving it a segmented appearance. Its misshapen head is crowned with at least eight eyes, and is dominated by a ring of four or five enormous, hook-like fangs surrounding the mouth. The creature's jaws extend like a tube out from its mouth when it is ready to feed, accompanied by a horrendous carrion stench and a nauseating squelching sound.",

				"Dragons are the ultimate representation of the chaos, ferocity, and reckless independence of red mana. They are found across Zendikar in mountainous regions where red mana is plentiful, particularly in Akoum, though never in great numbers.",
				"A dragon is an enormous reptilian monster with thick, tough scales and leathery wings. Sharp spines or thick plates run down its back, and most dragons have large horns. A dragon's body has a vaguely feline shape, with a long neck supporting a large head, and a long, thick tail lashing behind it. Its four legs end in sharp claws that are deadly weapons, and its mouth is full of sharp teeth. Even a young dragon is larger than a powerful warhorse, and the largest are on par with some of the larger Eldrazi (though not as mighty as the towering Eldrazi titans).",
				"The dragons of Zendikar are not particularly intelligent, especially in comparison to the genius dragon Planeswalker Nicol Bolas. They are more aware than the average beast and perhaps slightly smarter than an ogre, but dragons are still driven primarily by their instincts\u2014to hunt for prey and to guard their territories against any intruders. They are hot-tempered and ferocious, typically rending or incinerating anything they perceive as an enemy before even thinking to ask questions.",
				"A dragon's most fearsome aspect is its ability to exhale a blast of fire from its mouth. As it draws breath, a red glow like that of molten metal forms around its mouth, and is sometimes visible in its neck and chest as well. The fire then erupts in a long stream or a broad cone, shaped by the dragon as it chooses. A dragon might strafe the ground with fire as it flies overhead, covering as much ground\u2014and incinerating as many foes\u2014as possible. A grounded dragon turns its head back and forth as it breathes, blanketing its foes in flame or creating a barrier of burning earth to cover its retreat.",
				"The {@creature young red dragon} in the Monster Manual can represent the dragons of Zendikar, but its Intelligence score is only 8 (\u22121). This change has no effect on its other statistics."

				"With the power of magic at their disposal, mages of the ancient past and of Zendikar's present have been able to create objects bearing the semblance of life, capable of carrying out orders and even acting independently.",
				"In a number of ancient sites associated with the Eldrazi, stone creatures have been found standing eternal guard. Created from fragments of hedrons or carved to resemble them, these constructs were intended to help the people of Zendikar eliminate the brood lineages after the titans were imprisoned, and were implanted with a fragment of the power that bound and imprisoned the Eldrazi. They have served as useful allies in battling the Eldrazi broods, and some mages have had limited success in prying the secrets of their magic from their artificial minds. Other hedron constructs are of more recent make, fashioned in imitation of the originals. These have no power over the Eldrazi beyond what their physical strength gives them, and their creators used them for menial tasks. They are most often found in the ancient ruins of the kor or in merfolk cities. The various {@b modrons} can be used to represent these dedicated constructs.",
				"The golems of Zendikar are effectively artificial elementals, and can be represented by {@creature stone golem|MM|stone golems}. Mages fashion bodies from special stone and infuse them with the power of movement and limited understanding. Golems are rare and powerful, especially when shaped from stone that already possesses magical power."
