Other archdevils know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have secretly disseminated the means to call him from the Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the archdevil long enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from his post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been struck, Hutijin repays the interruption with death."

										"Exiled from the Nine Hells, Moloch would do anything to reclaim his position. Long ago, Moloch earned his place among the other archdevils through the glory he won driving demons out of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus rewarded him by elevating Moloch to the rulership of Malbolge.",
										"For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This animosity worked in Asmodeus's favor, since Asmodeus knew that Moloch's scheming helped keep the other archdevils in check. The arrangement began to unravel, however, when Moloch took the night hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her words were poison, and gradually she convinced Moloch to direct his efforts to topple Asmodeus.",
										"Although the conspiracy nearly succeeded, it was thwarted. Moloch was stripped of his station and sentenced to death\u2014and only the timely use of a planar portal allowed him to escape.",
										"Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return. He amassed an army of devils and monsters and left them to make final preparations for invading the Nine Hells, while he ventured to a distant Material Plane in the hope of finding an artifact that would ensure his success. While there, he became trapped, leaving his armies at the mercy of his enemies. In short order they were destroyed.",
										"Now, Moloch has been rendered nearly powerless after his last failure. He endlessly schemes of ways to return to his former status, but every time he enters the Nine Hells, he is demoted to an imp and can't regain his normal powers until he leaves. Thus, he lives a split existence, sometimes scheming in Malbolge or other layers of the Hells and at other times wandering the planes searching for magical might or secrets that might help him win back his title.",
										"Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, where he bargains with yugoloths to build yet another army with which he might invade Malbolge and wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little to offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to gain their aid in acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches in return for knowledge about the Nine Hells and the other planes.",
										"Most of Moloch's cultists have switched allegiance to one of the other archdevils, but idols constructed to honor him still stand in deep dungeons, their jeweled eyes and the remnants of power they hold drawing monstrous worshipers and unwise adventurers into places where his foul influence remains."

Dispater knows he has enemies on all sides\u2014enemies who would do to him what has been done to the likes of Geryon, Moloch, and so many others.",

A shrewd and calculating politician, he has clawed his way up through the ranks to become the second-most powerful fiend in Dis, entirely by saying just the right thing at the right time to get what he wanted. Charming and pleasant, he is a master at negotiation, able to twist words in such a way as to leave his victims confused and believing they have found a friend in Titivilus. Through these skills, Titivilus has manipulated everyone along his path to power, either to win them over to his cause or to remove them as a threat.",

In response, Dispater has withdrawn to his palace and left day-to-day decisions to Titivilus, while also authorizing him to answer and negotiate bargains with mortals who attempt to summon Dispater. Titivilus now represents his master and speaks with his voice, a turn of events that leads some to whisper that either Titivilus is Dispater in disguise, or that Titivilus has removed the archduke and replaced him altogether.",
										"Titivilus recognizes the inherent precariousness of his position. After all, Dispater's acceptance of his plans and his advice can last only so long before some other plotter steps in and reveals the truth. For insurance, Titivilus has begun recruiting outsiders to deal with problem devils, to insulate himself against criticism, and, above all, to create complications that he can solve so as to reinforce his value in the eyes of his master. Titivilus finds adventurers well suited to the tasks he needs performed and recruits them directly or through intermediaries, expending them later as his plans require."

Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things.

The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with Baphomet, the Horned King, and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sight.",

He wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat with his teeth."
