The true appearance of a dream eater is obscured, as the dream eater twists its hazy form into surreal illusions of its foes' greatest fears. However, all dream eaters share one thing: a gaping, always-smiling mouth, which it reveals before engulfing its prey in a phantasmagorical nightmare.",

It's too canny to be caught, but I'm certain some portion of the troops we've lost to Qualinesti ambushes in fact smolder in the wyrm's gut.
