Piyarz encouraged Sion to develop his arcane powers in secret, and in time Sion became a skilled shadow sorcerer. He kept his umbral abilities hidden from the tower's other residents. Even so, they all noticed his fervent devotion to Piyarz and, ironically, refer to him in private as \"Piyarz's shadow.\"",
						"Sion's sorcery allows him to step in and out of shadows and create shadowy duplicates of himself. He can even exercise limited control over others' shadows, causing the shadows to grasp their hosts and pin them in place. Wherever Sion goes, he's accompanied by his two pets, a ferocious hound and an oversized raven that help Sion track down his enemies. Spun by Sion from pure shadow, both creatures use the shadow stat block, but the raven has a flying speed of 40 feet."
