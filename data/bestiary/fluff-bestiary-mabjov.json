				"Aribeth was once an elven paladin of Tyr, the Blind God of Justice. Renowned for her beauty and beloved for her kindness, she was the personal guard of Nasher Alagonder, the lord of the city of Neverwinter. But when her fianc√©, Fenthick Moss, was unjustly hanged for treason, grief and a desire for vengeance corrupted her once noble spirit. She started down a path of revenge against her lord, her people, and even her god that ultimately ended with her own death.",
				"After she was killed, the arch devil Mephistopheles sought out Aribeth's spirit in Hell. He made a bargain with the fallen paladin, offering her a chance to mete out justice once again as she had done when she served Tyr. Aribeth accepted and was returned to the world of the living.",
				"The decades Aribeth had spent in hell, along with the betrayals she had experienced in her first life, had transformed her into a shell of a person. Devoid of conscience, remorse, and compassion, Mephistopheles made her into a hunter of those who had broken pacts made with the powers of Hell.",
				"But despite his efforts to completely break her, Mephistopheles soon recognized that a tiny spark of Aribeth's former kindness and compassion remained, buried deep within her. In acknowledgement of this, he bestowed upon Aribeth an unholy sword called Void that would eat the souls of its victims, sparing them from being damned to the eternal suffering of the Nine Hells. However, Mephistopheles only granted Aribeth permission to use this sword to spare one out of every nine victims, knowing that choosing who to save and who to let suffer would be a constant burden that would eventually corrupt the last noble vestiges of Aribeth's soul.",
				"But Aribeth was smart enough to understand her overlord's true plan. Instead of actively selecting who Void will spare, she makes the choice by using a simple, but extremely precise, scale that resembles the holy symbol she once carried as a priest of Tyr. When she encounters her victims, she asks them for a gold piece. If they give it to her, she places it on the scale, measuring the weight to the thousandth of an ounce. If the scale comes to balance on the last digit of \"9\", she will slay them with Void, sparing her the emotional burden of personally deciding who will be cast down and who will be spared.",
				"Even now, though she still serves as an avatar of Mephistopheles, Aribeth is not evil in the strict sense. Her victims are never the innocent, and she only unleashes her savage justice upon those who deserve it through their own choices and actions. And she takes no pleasure in her duties; no cruel revelry in the suffering she inflicts. In this way she is more akin to a relentless force of nature\u2014unstoppable and uncaring, but unbiased in her dispensation of dark justice."

Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch.",
				"However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted. Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil. Any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him.",
				"Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even if trapped in the form of a slug, he is still the Lord of Lies, whose every deception is made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind. Only other devils are safe from his lies, as Baalzebul wishes to return to his original beautiful form.",
				"If forced into combat Baalzebul's first tactic is to belch out gargantuan clouds of flesh-devouring flies. Baalzebul's stench is so putrid that simply trying to get anywhere close to him is sickening. Despite his bloated form, he can still burrow underground and easily scale surfaces. He is easy to track, since he always leaves a thick layer of putrid slime in his wake."

But he was particularly fond of dwarves, whom he considered a delicacy. Supremely arrogant, Dagryn believe no denizens of the Underdark could challenge his power, until he had the misfortune of angering a coven of hags.",
				"The hags trapped and killed the great wyrm, but instead of leaving him for dead, they reincarnated him in the form of a dwarf\u2014a twisted joke on the once fearsome creature. In a final mockery of his former glory, they branded him with the name Dagryn\u2014a bastardized echo of the mighty beast he once had been. Dagryn has now lived so many years as a dwarf that the memories of his life before the reincarnation have mostly faded. In addition to forgetting his true name, he no longer remembers his origin world, though he knows that Faer√ªn is not where he was born.",
				"In the early years after his transformation, Dagryn discovered another cruel quirk of the hag's curse. After several years his wretched existence as a lowly dwarf became unbearable, and Dagryn was driven to suicide. But upon his death, he woke to discover his body had been restored to its original dragon form. However, his joy was short lived\u2014after 24 hours he once again shifted back into his dwarven shape... but now he had a malformed leg, giving him a painful limp.",
				"Over the next decades, the true scope of the horror inflicted upon him became apparent. Each time his dwarven body was killed, he would be reborn as a dragon for a single day. And each time he turned back into a dwarf he would find himself afflicted with some new infirmity: arthritic joints; rotting teeth; punishing migraines; constant ulcers.",

Whenever he is killed\u2014a somewhat frequent occurrence, as a frail, old dwarf is an easy target\u2014he spends his time as a dragon unleashing mad vengeance upon the world in an orgy of death, destruction, and mayhem. As a result, he has developed two very distinct and contrasting personalities: the timid, subservient dwarf and the raging, hate-filled dragon."

				"Typically appearing as a beautiful, young elven woman clad in golden jewelry, Darien is usually accompanied by several scantily clad and equally beautiful \"bodyguards\", all of whom seem to be comfortable in any climate, no matter how cold. However, in reality Darien is a powerful half-ogre illusionist and the golden jewelry aren't simply valuable trinkets, but the soul circlets of skeleton warriors\u2014the magically disguised bodyguards that accompany her. Worst of all, Darien is driven by a disturbing obsession for those who call themselves adventurers.",
				"Born to a human mother who died at birth, Darien was rescued by an elven adventurer from Evereska named Vail. Vail tried to keep Darien's nature a secret from the elves of Evereska, knowing that they would never accept a half-ogre. When Darien was in her teens, Vail taught her illusion magic which she could use to change her appearance and create an entirely different identity. Darien modeled her looks and behavior off an elven girl named Shirri\u2014a young elven princess that Darien idolized to the point of obsession. But Darien lacked the grace and refinement of a true elf and despite looking the part, she was never accepted by the elven youth of Evereska.",
				"One spring, when Vail was away on a campaign, Darien kidnapped Shirri. She kept her a prisoner for weeks, obsessively studying her in order to learn how to mimic her poise and speech. She both loved and hated Shirri, and her moods would constantly shift between fawning adoration and bitter resentment. She would often shower her prisoner with gifts, like rich cakes and beautiful clothes, but even the smallest, seemingly insignificant thing could trigger a sudden bout of rage, causing Darien to lock Shirri for days in the cellar, naked, cold, and starving.",
				"When Vail returned, he was horrified to discover what Darien had done and cast her out of Evereska. Banished, Darien wandered the Greycloak Hills that protect Evereska, hoping to die in the snows of an early winter. Instead, she was found by a force of Elemental Evil: Cryonax, Prince of Ice. A pact was made, and Darien survived the winter to make her way down into the civilized lands of the Sword Coast.",
				"Darien's natural talent with illusion magic, coupled with the power that Cryonax provided, allowed her to thrive. In her travels, she became obsessed with the men and women that called themselves adventurers. These bands of treasure hunting thrill seekers seemed to exist outside of the normal order of the world. They did what they liked and became rich and powerful doing so. They also reminded her of the one man who had ever showed her love\u2014Vail.",
				"Darien is parasitic in nature. The smallest word or act\u2014or even seeing them across a crowded room\u2014will cause her to become obsessed with an individual. From that point on she will use all her powers to insert herself into their life, typically by hiring her victim for a high-paying adventuring job. If her machinations fail, however, she is not averse to resorting to brute force such as enchantment magic or taking loved ones as hostages to compel compliance.",
				"Ultimately, she wants the targets of her obsessive infatuation to come to love and respect her. If she is not shown the love that she craves, then she will lash out. Often this means that she will wait for an opportune time to \"rescue\" them from a battle not going their way. These adventurers might wake to find themselves hostages of Darien, where they must endure her erratic emotional outbursts and cruel mind games until they either escape, are rescued, or are driven into total madness."

He originally traveled west to the Sword Coast on a mission to kill the Rashemi Wychlaran Dynaheir, both as part of a personal rivalry and under orders from his superior Red Wizards. Once his mission was accomplished, and Dynaheir was dead, Edwin remained on the Sword Coast in order to build up his own personal power without the oversight of the Zulkirs of Thay.",

His short time studying the Nether Scroll resulted in some calamitous results, but one of the spells he learned imparted him with the longevity of an elf.",

(His envy of the legendary wizard Elminster Aumar is particularly venomous.) Edwin has a simulacrum of himself that he uses to augment his power or send into dangerous situations.

As she grew older, Eo became increasingly useful to the Haphrat's families plans and schemes, eventually becoming a key cog in their complex machinations. Only then did Belic realize his daughter had been carefully manipulating him her entire life, working herself into a position of power and influence in his affairs so she could betray him. By then, however, it was too late, and Eo used her power to take control of Belic's mind, his family, and his wealth before ultimately discarding her adopted father when he ceased to be useful.",

Her infatuation with her kinfolk\u2014demons, devils, and dragons\u2014has led her to walk the Nine Hells, playing dice games with demon lords and signing contracts with archdevils. She has sought audience with dragons of all kinds, including several of the most ancient wyrms in all of Faer√ªn. There are even rumors she possess a dragon orb, one of the most rare and powerful magical items.",

Eo believes that the promise of the afterlife is a conspiracy by the gods to trick mortals into living lives of conformity, preparing them to be consigned to an eternity of sheer boredom after they die. In this way, Eo believes, the status quo of the Heavens and the Hells can be more easily maintained. Eo rebels against this status quo by pursuing earthly pleasures in all their forms, regardless of the long-term costs. She lives almost exclusively in the moment, relying on her wealth, fame, and privilege to protect her against any serious consequences of her actions.",

Eager to be recognized as the most beautiful and the most powerful woman in history, she has spent much of her ill-gotten Thayvian fortune in a campaign to be elected Duke of Baldur's Gate. In her pursuit of political power, she continually tries to buy the love and loyalty of the populace with extravagant festivals where wine and illicit drugs are freely available in virtually unlimited quantities. While winning many of the ordinary citizens to her side, these public orgies have put her at odds with the reigning political establishment and various religious figures championing a more traditional morality.",

Rumor has it that Eo gambled his soul away in a drunken game of cards with some fiendish lord, though there is no proof as to his fate. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain\u2014Eo is desperate to find him... though whether for his sake or simply to protect her own reputation is up for debate."

He has been known to pass off the bones of Uthgardt tribespeople as a substitute for orc fingers in the hopes of claiming outstanding bounties, and he once slaughtered an entire village of innocent gnomes, then tried to pass off their scalps as goblin heads.

This early exposure to the mythology of the Lord of Murder intrigued Kagain, but nothing ever came from it. However, one drunken night in Baldur's Gate, Kagain and several of his mercenaries were set upon by Bhaal while they stumbled home. Despite murdering all his companions, the god spared Kagain on the condition that he become one of his devout followers. Given his love for killing, his lust for gold, and his utter lack of loyalty to his slain brothers-in-arms, it was an easy choice for the black-hearted dwarf",

Current members include the tasloi poisoner named Gixis; a gnoll tracker that goes by the name \"Hungry\" and a dread doppelganger Kagain refers to as the \"Face Peeler\"."

During his time as an archdevil he had been responsible for many schemes to try and unseat the Lord of the Nine. One of his infamous schemes was an alliance between himself, Dispater, Mammon, and Geryon. They conspired to take power from the other archdevils, Baalzebul, Zariel, Belial and Moloch. With this increased power, Mephistopheles would then be able to challenge Asmodeus himself. But he was betrayed by Geryon, who had been secretly siding with Asmodeus. Despite the blatancy of his rebellion, he was the archdevil that suffered the least: not cursed like Mammon or Baalzebul; not cast down like Belial, Moloch or Geryon. This has led many to believe that there is some ancient secret to the relationship between the Asmodeus and Mephistopheles, though what it could be is a mystery none have discovered.",

But beneath this civil persona lurks a savage, barely controlled temper, and he often flies into uncontrollable rages when alone in his palace.

Created by tapping into the profane essence of Hell, Hellfire is unimaginably, unbearably hot. Unless he chooses to suppress it, his body emanates dark flames, causing anyone who touches him to be scorched by the unholy energy. Mephistopheles can also shape Hellfire any way he wishes, making it his most potent weapon."
