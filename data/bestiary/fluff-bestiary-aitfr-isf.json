				"With his skin aglow like searing coal, a beard like sheafs of burnt paper, and hair billowing like smoke, Exul's physical form does nothing to hide his elemental nature. He was born as a spirit of earth and flame. This physical manifestation is a dalliance of mere decades, he hopes.",
				"Exul serves Tyreus not out of loyalty, but due to a geas. Exul bears Tyreus only a little ill will, however, as occasional \"arrangements\" with mortal wizards are no great hassle. Exul resents and avoids the pain of the geas, ideally, but has no intention of dying for Tyreus's petty, mortal ambitions."

				"Now alone on his mission, Malivar doesn't hesitate to use or abuse the trust of others if it means he can get revenge, return to Thay alive, and report on Morwena's betrayal."
