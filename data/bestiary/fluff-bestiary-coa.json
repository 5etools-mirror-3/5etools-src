Halogs live among the flames of Phlegethos, the icy wastes of Stygia and the swamps of Minauros equally, and no devil city is free of their swarming presence no matter how the Fiends try to exterminate them. They even swim rat-like in the waters of the Styx. The vermin have a powerful defense mechanism. Their saliva and blood adapts swiftly in response to the vulnerabilities of their antagonists so that their bites inflict the worst harm, and anything trying to eat their flesh suffers for it.

They seem to have an ever-open beak, but upon closer scrutiny this shows to be a pair of vicious spikes. Although they seem like horrific flying creatures, the actual truth of their origins makes them even more terrible. Malagard was earthbound and one of the many things she was furiously envious of was the ability of others to fly. One of her pastimes was to tear the wings from Fiends who had displeased her and give them a vile and unnatural life of their own, discarding the mutilated devils and shaping their amputated parts into something new and ghastly. Shredwings are the results of her hobby, now feral and endemic to many parts of the Nine Hells."

They patrol the skies of the Nine Hells and descend in shrieking flocks on anything weak enough to torment. When they have winged creatures at their mercy, they mob their victim in the air until they can tear away their target's wings. They carry the trophies to their high roosts, where the tattered vanes are transformed into a new shredwing under the caustic ministrations of the 'parents'. For wingless prey, they have other practices. Whilst they harry with claws and beak, they look out for a chance to latch onto the backs of their prey. Driving the spikes of their heads between the shoulders of their victims they enact a terrible merging, becoming a set of wings attached to the creature and carrying them off. They slowly absorb the life-force of their victim, delighting in their pain and fear. Over time they take over their prey's limbs and body, returning to attack any leftover companions, delighting in the distress their puppeteering causes. Most often they leave the head until last, enjoying the screams and pleas of the luckless creature they've usurped."

In contrast to the unruly hosts of the Abyss, devils are never permitted to give vent to the bitterness that is their lot, bound to a show of discipline and obedience. This festering misery, given no other outlet, manifests as an independent creature that breaks from the devil who generated it to pursue its own malevolent life.

The minds of strong mortals valiantly enduring the horrors of the Nine Hells without complaint draw them from far away, and they hunger both for the flesh and the fear such prey generate. A truly satisfying feast for the tyrants must be prepared properly. They stalk their targets over long hours, telepathically sensing what is most feared and shifting their forms to provide glimpses and hints of terror wherever their target looks. Mortals who break easily, giving swift vent to their fear or flying into berserk rages, are of little interest to them. A fear that slowly erodes through its host's iron discipline is savored like a well-aged wine. For the same reason, they gleefully prey on middling and lesser devils whose lives are a constant battle between bitterness and discipline. Those few mortals who are so confident in themselves as to know no fear at all\u2014the most focused of monks or blessed of paladins perhaps\u2014are effectively invisible to tyrant shadows."

Much as they might deny it, even the greatest of devils are consumed with negative emotions. Archdevils command whole planes yet hate and envy the gods. Somewhere perhaps even Asmodeus has a stalking shadow feeding his malice even as his great status empowers it."
