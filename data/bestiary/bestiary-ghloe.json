A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. However, a creature that fails two of these saving throws becomes cursed. A creature cursed in this way takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points, and the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. Every 24 hours, the cursed creature takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage with similar reduction to the creature's hit point maximum. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies."
