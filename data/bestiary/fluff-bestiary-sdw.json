								"Lhammaruntosz, a bronze dragon with the ability to heal quickly, spent decades defending Leilon and the surrounding area as the captain of the Scaly Eye, a fleet that battled pirates and other threats. To honor her deeds, the Swords of Leilon constructed the Bronze Shrine, a massive temple to Bahamut, god of metallic dragons, in a cliff overlooking the sea. The shrine's face is carved in Lhammaruntosz's likeness and includes quarters for the rest of the Scaly Eye and a magic statue of Bahamut, which the dragon can use to commune with the deity.",
								"In recent decades Lhammaruntosz has retreated inside the shrine, becoming reclusive due to a attack by a disguised demon which has driven her mad. She leaves on rare occasions to hunt for food, returning as soon as possible. Members of the Scaly Eye still live within the Bronze Shrine, as Lhammaruntosz has ordered them to stay on as her guardians."
