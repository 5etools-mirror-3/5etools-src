He joined his friends, Sylvene and Artura, on their journey into the wilds of the Sword Coast, all those years ago, and was part of their adventuring party with a human from Secomber named Waltarn Everlake. That Hamish would be willing to risk his life to protect his friends was never in doubt.",

Being a giant, he brought both a dungeoneer's pack and an explorer's pack in his knapsack. He carries a big axe, suitable for his size. He also carried a round, wooden shield, made just for him by Artura, but it has rotted to bits.",
