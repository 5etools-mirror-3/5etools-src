Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in places, held aloft by the dragon's psychic force while the dragon lives. These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragon's mood, bobbing in amusement or flaring dangerously with anger. Its scales and wing membranes are varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky, to the rich crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice. In the light, many of their scales glitter and shine with luminous starburst images.",

Those have been long sealed with natural-looking stone thanks to the dragon's command over its lair's substance.",
