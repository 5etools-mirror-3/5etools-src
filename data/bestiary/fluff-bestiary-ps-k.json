Some inventors view angels in the context of the Aether Cycle as an expression of a Great Design. Given divine inspiration and an utterly perfect stage of innovation, an angel is the constructed result\u2014a living invention. Their masks, headdresses, and armor give them an almost mechanical appearance, but they are living beings with brightly colored skin almost entirely concealed beneath their armor and decorative robes. Because of their perfection, angels are believed to be immune to the final stages of the Aether Cycle, which would involve their destruction.",

But the sight of an angel is thought to be a good omen, and in particular, it is believed to presage success with invention.",

Some angels (such as the one shown on the {@link Angel of Invention card|https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=547813}) wield four swords with their four arms. When such an angel uses the Multiattack action, it makes four attacks rather than two. However, its weapons deal only an extra {@damage 1d10} radiant damage from its Angelic Weapons trait, so that each sword attack deals 7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) slashing damage plus 5 ({@damage 1d10}) radiant damage on a hit."
