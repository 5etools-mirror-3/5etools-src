Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator.

Although nomadic, the prowlers are quite territorial of whatever area they currently inhabit.
