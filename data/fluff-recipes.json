The ginger offers the dish a pleasing warmth and an unexpected nuance, more than an overt gingery flavor, while the fermented hard pear cider provides a touch of residual sweetness, albeit dry and earthy. Don't fret, if you can't track down hard pear cider (sometimes called \"perry\"), then apple will do just fine!

If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining.

Although several orc elders live among Minmax people serving as healers, shamans, and storytellers, the clan, led by the fearsome and wise Kalatuur Minmax, has embraced an atypical approach to food and politics. Similarly, their palate ranges greatly, from subtler human fare such as fish, cheese, and bread to the orcish desire for big-game meat.

				"Ideal as a filling comfort food, cloaks are finger snacks made from whipped potatoes, eggs, butter, and fresh spices. They get their name from their shape; as they bake, puffing into luxurious, golden-brown coverings, which look like warm winter cloaks. While some taverns pan-sear Cloaks in oil to give them a crispy, crunchy exterior, most establishments bake them and the dish is often thought to be best right out of the oven, soft and piping hot inside. On a cold day, a few Cloaks will warm you right up. In Kalaman they squeeze a bit of lemon juice on top to give it a little zing, and in springtime, it's not unusual to find a few edible flowers draped over them. Cloaks make a perfect side for fish or poultry, but eat enough of them, and you may end up skipping the main course entirely."

				"Kaeth, or coffee, is an aromatic brew made from ground roasted beans and is famous for its invigorating properties, making it a prevalent day starter throughout the worlds of the multiverse. In Sigil, the City of Doors, planar sightseers can sample from a wide array of coffee beans and beverages from countless planets. Kaeth, as it is commonly called on the planet Toril, has developed into quite the delicacy along the Sword Coast, where it is now imported in droves. In the nation of Sembia, a popular method of preparation features a blend of melted chocolate and liquor. In some areas, kaeth is so popular that it has become more profitable than the tea trade. The peoples of the planet Krynn drink tarbean tea and kefre, both of which are derived from vibrant, dark-roasted beans and frequently served black. In contrast, citizens of the Outer Planes imbibe numerous spiced and creamed variants of kaeth, including the notable Mountain Majesty of Mount Celestia. On the planet Oerth, coffee trends more acidic and is frequently blended into creamy liquors to grant an extra kick. But perhaps the most notable, kav'la, in which creamed coconut milk is swirled into a malted, dark, nutty roast, is served in tall, ornate ceramic vessels and is easily found in the cultured bazaars of Sigil. Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead."

While you won't find this stir-fried entrÃ©e on just any tavern menu, it has found its way into the more modern eateries of cultural epicenters such as Waterdeep.

However, in its earlier incarnations, raston pastry dated back to the first Dragon War, when not even scraps of stale bread could be discarded. Crusts of stale bread were habitually tossed into a basin and later mashed to create livestock feed, but the kender saw an opportunity. Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread. So popular was kender loaf that the process was refined with eggs, cream, and spices, evolving into the bread puddings we know today."

However, ask a kender adventurer, and you may as likely hear a yarn concerning a well-placed insult aimed toward a draconian corporal and his squad. As the bold kender scoundrel made haste to flee, he frantically threw about any valuables behind him to dissuade his pursuers. In his desperation, he ejected a small sack of mixed spices, hardened cheese, a jar of mustard, and several handfuls of uncooked spiral pasta shells that, as kender luck would have it, served as a meal of caltrops for draconian toes and sent the kender's pursuers stumbling into the mud. In honor of this brave kender's sacrifice (the loss of a perfectly good sack of pasta), kender across Krynn have memorialized the occasion in classic, good-humored kender fashion."

The Wizard of Wines Vineyard is legendary for producing some of the finest wines throughout the planes and multiverse, such as the full-bodied Red Dragon Crush and the crisp Champagne du le Stomp. But not all wines that emerge from the mists of Barovia are of equal quality, as evidenced by the existence of Purple Grapemash No. 3. Priced at only three copper pieces per pint at most local taverns and other Domains of Dread, this table wine is known to be spectacularly unremarkable. However, in some areas of the Shadowfell, clever mixologists have added copious amounts of ice and lime juice to the pungent grape-ish mix, turning this otherwise mediocre concoction into a refreshing, slushy treat worth at least four copper pieces anywhere."

				"In the world of Krynn, shortly after the ancient Kinslayer Wars, Prince Kith-Kanan appealed to his brother King Sithas for western sovereignty. His brother peacefully granted the western elves independence from the nation of Silvanesti. However, Kith-Kanan, the new king of the western elves, was met with decades of hardships resulting from the diaspora. Until their capital Qualinost was founded, his elven people struggled to find new ways of living off the land. Several simple and humble meals entered the repertoire of the elven diet, including \"Harvest Prize,\" an artfully prepared baked vegetable casserole. Sourceable produce such as eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomato were thinly sliced then stacked in fanned layers upon fresh basil and tomato (crushed into a sauce), then drizzled with fresh and fragrant oils before roasting. This humble yet abundant dish could feed an entire elven village at little cost. Although the elves of Krynn now prepare variations of this dish year-round with inspired substitutions to harness the seasons, the combination below is the most classic and recommended."

Named after an orc henchman of Lord Robilar, who inventively cooked this sausage meal for his adventuring party, using his shield for a skillet, Quij's Plate would eventually earn its place on the menu of the famed Green Dragon Inn, nestled in the Free City of Greyhawk's bustling River Quarter.

One ceremonial dish (to which the Reghed stake proud claim) that marks the beginning of the long winter is pot roast. A tender flank of beast, chunks of dried apricots, halved gold potatoes, and branches of seasonal herbs intermingle with the natural wild meat juices to make this an especially aromatic and practical single-course meal.",

The Blade and Stars, a tried-and-true establishment in the port city of Baldur's Gate, offers a remarkable interpretation of this offshore staple using a traditional ruby port instead of fermented Moonshae cherry juices.

Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of FaerÃ»n, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road."

				"You don't need to frequent FaerÃ»nian ports such as Neverwinter, Waterdeep, or Baldur's Gate to enjoy this stewed ocean-meat medley. Served in taverns, in homesteads, and on seafaring vessels across countless realms, this eternally popular nautical dish consists of cod, or haddock, clams, and mussels simmered in a light fish and tomato stock with a licorice-flavored aperitif and a pinch of fennel. Some taverns even make theirs with an impressive serving of aldani\u2014if they can manage to defeat one! A rouille\u2014a nippy red pepper, garlic, and olive oil blend\u2014helps complete the aromatic dish served year-round. The flavorful broth is also perfect for soaking toasted herb breads. Swashbucklers and sea rogues alike never turn down a ladleful."

While the baking process seals in flavor, it also ensures its portability, making talyth a common travel snack along the major FaerÃ»nian trade routes. Although frozen talyth can easily be reheated on an open campfire, freshly made talyth affords a more eclectic and adventurous array of savory ingredients, including diced egg, oysters, snails, and even spiced worms."
