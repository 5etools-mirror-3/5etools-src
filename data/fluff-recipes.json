It is said that a half-orc named Mazmorras was the first to discover this pungent recipe for cured pork strips, which you can practically taste from twenty yards away. Sometimes called \"the Pork of Gruumsh,\" orcs flavor it with black pepper and garlic; a halfling might instead smooth off the edge with some maple syrup. Experienced adventuring parties venturing into orc lands know that dropping a bundle of bacon can throw pursuers off their trail, and orcs have even been known to barter with humans who carry it. For best results, try using Thayan Doomvault Swine Run pork\u2014it has the right potency."

This succulent, slow-cooked beef chuck roast, inspired by a popular regional recipe that originated with the Oglyntyr family in the village of Amphail, is prepared with cider, pear, and ginger\u2014all of which help to activate the full flavor of the meat. The ginger offers the dish a pleasing warmth and an unexpected nuance, more than an overt gingery flavor, while the fermented hard pear cider provides a touch of residual sweetness, albeit dry and earthy. Don't fret, if you can't track down hard pear cider (sometimes called \"perry\"), then apple will do just fine! Roasted sweet potatoes or winter squash make a savory accompaniment and taste wonderful with a ladle or two of sweet au jus."

If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining. While Luiren is no more, this famous dish can still be found on board various halfling-crewed spelljammers who commandeered this dish as their own."

The grumpy dwarven smithy took pity on the students, allowed them a place on the stones, and made them hot black tea to warm them from the inside.",
				"Word spread of Hammerbind's kindness, and other students joined them that night, bringing with them gifts of strong liquor, exotic herbs, and even sugar and fruit. Hammerbind mixed the offerings to stretch the tea a little further, and Candlekeep Tea was born. Every time a storm hits, the poorest adjutants are welcomed to the forge for warmth, and together with Hammerbind, they make a new tea, a little different every time. The recipe below is a typical example, but everyone is encouraged to add what they can to the pot."

Their traditional preparation of the enormous salmon that spawn in that river, like much else in Aundair, relies heavily on sauces: in this case a butter and dark wine reduction. The aristocracy would sample only a tiny fillet before moving on to further courses, but in simpler households, a single dragon salmon could feed a family. After their fish, the locals would turn to a cremfel, a thin pancake stuffed with rich cream and slices of fresh fruit."

The result was a perfectly balanced, spicy and sweet concoction that satisfied and warmed the insides of both groups as they spent cold winters constructing their shared fortress of Pax Tharkas. Years later, during the War of the Lance, this recipe was popularized by Lord Gunthar, Grand Master of the Knights of Solamnia, who would serve it to visiting knights (and himself) as a favorite nightcap.

In addition to the sesame seeds and anise seeds, a strong brandy is often infused into the mix, to both sweeten and fortify these small pressed cakes. While fig cakes do not come cheap, they are, nonetheless, a proud (and delicious) reminder of the resourcefulness of the Shadar-Kai."

An unexpected journey of flavors, fresh wild-picked carrots are simmered with mountain-grown {@recipe kaeth|HFFotM} (or coffee) and a generous amount of beet-derived molasses. A touch of thyme and finely aged balsamic vinegar round out this sweet and acidic treat, so perfectly balanced that even the eladrin of the Feywild often include it as a staple of their elaborate forest feasts. The harengon, rabbit-like denizens of the Feywild, famously prepare this dish with a veritable rainbow of orange, red, white, yellow, and purple carrots, emphasizing presentation as much as flavor. The inspired infusion of coffee provides a robust tang that will also add zip to anyone's step, especially the harengon who are known for their exuberance. When it comes to the serving table, this vibrant fall side is bound to bring you back for more."

Made with fresh Feywild blackberries, Sembian honey, and a touch of Prismeer vanilla, these tasty tarts can be found from Hither and Thither to Yon and everywhere in between. But remember, the hospitality of a night hag always comes with a catch\u2014their baking prowess is nothing but a lure for sweet-toothed souls, and there's always room in a night hag's soul bag for one more."

Merchants from Luskan and beyond pay top dollar for these curios, which have become all the rage throughout the cities of Faerûn. As a result, lakes of Ten Towns often run red with the blood of local fisherman competing for the day's catch.

The Blade and Stars, a tried-and-true establishment in the port city of Baldur's Gate, offers a remarkable interpretation of this offshore staple using a traditional ruby port instead of fermented Moonshae cherry juices.

Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust.

After much puzzling by local alchemists over the remaining stock she carried, they determined it was not a meat at all but a curious vegetable compound seasoned to deliver the essence of meat.

				"Sometimes called \"fungus two ways,\" this zesty duergar essential is sure to rouse the taste buds of even the most spice-crazed tiefling. Made from the bright-white roots of Underdark lotus or bluecap fungus, these tubers are steamed and then cut thin into crunchy, round slices, perfect for dipping. However, if you can't source authentic Underdark produce, sliced radishes have a similar texture and flavor, and even jicama, cucumbers, or romaine lettuce can work in a pinch. The star of the show, however, is the spread, made from the pale-orange fire lichen fungus that is ground into a delectable spicy paste. But make sure to keep a waterorb handy\u2014this stuff is hot!"

				"For those fortunate enough to visit the Radiant Citadel, a shining and otherworldly beacon of civilization deep in the Ethereal Plane, it is a nearly unrivaled cultural experience. Much more than a crossroads for weary interplanar pilgrims seeking passage to the founding civilizations of the Material Plane, the citadel is a veritable hub of flavors and cuisine all its own. The vanilla buns sold at Vada's Otherworldly Goods, made by the famous baker and Citadel resident Vada, are a scrumptious street-treat hailing from Siabsunkoh's famed Dyn Singh Market, nicknamed the Dancing Night Market due to its ever-shifting forms and truly magical and festive nature. These delicate rolled pastries are baked in a tightly packed bundle, resulting in a freshly cooked tray that resembles a bouquet of golden flowers. Crispy on the outside and cloudlike in the middle, these vanilla-flavored morsels don't last long at Vada's, or anywhere you find them, so be sure to grab one while you can. Although the original bun is crafted from a secret family recipe, this recipe is as close to the real thing as you are going to find."

				"Popularized in Khorvaire's frigid northeastern nation of Karrnath, this savory dinner bread has staved off numerous famines and sometimes served as an all-in-one ration for the country's living soldiers (don't ask what the non-living soldiers eat). Traditionally prepared with sharp, \"ved\" cheese and presented with onion butter, these crusty buns are best served warm, but can sometimes last for days on the shelf without the use of magical means or preservatives. Unsurprisingly, this tasty staple has migrated to many different worlds, each adding its own local flourish and embracing it as their own. This particular recipe comes from Lorren's Bakery in Faerûn's Village of Red Larch, and features mushrooms and cheese from local, outlying farms. Pair it with some drippings and skewered capons or {@recipe Hommlet Golden Brown Roasted Turkey with Sausage Stuffing and Drippings||golden brown roasted turkey} from Drouth's Fine Poultry nearby, and you've got yourself a meal."

				"Whole roast boar, or some parts thereof, is a favorite at the banquets of vampire hosts throughout the Domains of Dread. It is rumored that hosts wait until their guests are \"glassy of eye, greasy of chin, and a drowsy cheer has come upon them\" to insert a single fang to the jugular of each guest and exsanguinate to their taste. Proper preparation requires of the cook an unabashed love of jam, port, and brown sugar, applied with a heavy hand to flavor the meat, ensuring that you and your guests will leave nothing on your plates. For those lucky travelers fortunate enough to escape the fog-shrouded confines of Barovia to Toril, a variation of this hearty and succulent feast is a specialty of the Boar with Black Tusks in Noanar's Hold, which sometimes uses pork when a boar cannot be procured and is often served with a dry ruby wine from Cormyr."

Some barkeeps substitute amaretto for a liqueur that mimics the taste of almond but forgoes nuts entirely in favor of herbs and spice, while others add their own twists to the tried-and-true recipe. In any case, the desired result is a smooth and creamy nut drink with a strong kick and a vibrant aftertaste that might include subtle variations ranging from sweet or tangy to salted or roasted."
