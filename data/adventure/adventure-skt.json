				"You are about to embark on a great adventure that pits heroes against giants bent on reshaping the world. {@i Storm King's Thunder} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure for four to six player characters. You can start the adventure with 1st-level characters or 5th-level characters. Either way, the characters should reach at least 11th level by the adventure's conclusion. Because giants figure prominently in the story, at least one character should be able to speak and understand the Giant language.",
				"The adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Savage Frontier, in the northwest corner of the continent of Faerûn. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.",
				"We recommend that you read the entire adventure before attempting to run it. This introduction begins with an \"{@area Adventure Background|001|x}\" section that summarizes the events that set the adventure in motion. The \"{@area Running the Adventure|016|x}\" section tells you everything you need to know to run the adventure smoothly. That section also presents guidelines for character level advancement, outlines the flow of the adventure, and describes its major challenges. Once you've reviewed this material and are ready to run the adventure, proceed with chapter 1, \"{@adventure A Great Upheaval|SKT|1},\" if the characters are starting at 1st level, or chapter 2, \"{@adventure Rumblings|SKT|2},\" if they are starting at 5th level.",

						"The Savage Frontier (also known as the North) is a cold, rugged, sparsely populated land of snow-capped mountains, rocky hills, sprawling forests, and foggy vales. Isolated strongholds, ancient burial mounds, and the ruins of many forgotten empires dot this vast landscape. Bounded by the Sea of Swords to the west and the desert of Anauroch to the east, the Savage Frontier extends as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the town of Daggerford. Old roads stretch across this great expanse, linking the dwarven strongholds and mines in the mountains to the coastal settlements, frontier towns, and fortified outposts of humans and other folk. These roads are long, lonely, or poorly defended, making them dangerous to traverse. In fertile valleys, towns and cities have sprung up, separated by dozens if not hundreds of miles of untamed wilderness haunted by bandits, barbarians, and monsters.",
						"Evil dragons stirred into action by their dark queen, Tiamat, threatened the settlements of the Savage Frontier for a time. Ultimately, they were defeated and forced to withdraw to their lairs, while Tiamat was banished to the Nine Hells. Fear of the dragons' wrath has faded quickly with the coming of a new threat: giants. The peoples of the North are no strangers to giant incursions. Frost giants have long claimed the Spine of the World as their demesne, and hill giants are known to scrounge for food in the untamed hills. But now, in the past couple of months, giants of every kind have emerged from their strongholds in force to threaten civilization as never before\u2014and not just frost giants and hill giants, but also stone giants, fire giants, and cloud giants. All of the giants are in an uproar. Reports of giant attacks throughout the North have reached the coastal cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep, stoking fears that the giants are waging war against humans, dwarves, elves, and other small folk.",

								"Giant society (such as it is) is defined in large part by the ordning, a caste system imposed upon the giants by their gods, chief among them Annam the All-Father. The ordning determines where a giant stands among his or her ilk. Traditionally, storm giants have stood at the top of the ordning. Tall and powerful, they struggle to keep the weaker races of giants from despoiling the realms of small folk and sparking conflict. The greatest storm giants are powerful seers, skilled at identifying and interpreting cosmic signs and divine omens. The aloof and aristocratic cloud giants, one step below the storm giants, rarely condescend to deal with lesser giants or small folk. Extravagance defines their culture and their place in the ordning. Below them are the tyrannical, warmongering fire giants and the merciless, predatory frost giants. Fire giants rank themselves by their forging skill, whereas frost giants rank themselves by their martial prowess. Near the bottom of the ordning are the xenophobic stone giants, who mostly live underground and regard the surface world as a realm of dreams. How well they sculpt stone determines their place among their peers. The lowest and smallest of the true giants are the hill giants, as gluttonous as they are loathsome. Hill giants are dullards who live in fear of their more powerful giant cousins. In hill giant society, the biggest rule.",
								"Dragons are the ancient enemies of giants. Thousands of years ago, the last great empire of giants\u2014Ostoria\u2014fell after a long and brutal conflict with dragons. Little of Ostoria remains in what is now called the Savage Frontier. The civilizations of small folk have taken over the land once ruled by giants. Although evil giants make occasional forays into territory settled by small folk, their ambitions have long been curtailed by their lack of cohesion and the imposition of good-aligned storm giants and cloud giants whose memories of ancient, glorious Ostoria have faded over time.",
								"The recent efforts by dragons to bring Tiamat into the world (as told in the adventures {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}) and the attempts by small folk to thwart them so upset the giant gods that Annam the All-Father shattered the ordning between the giants to break his \"children\" out of their complacency, pitting the six giant types against one another while keeping some semblance of order within each type. In so doing, Annam has spurred cloud, fire, frost, stone, and hill giants to challenge the established hierarchy and reforge their destiny. All the giants sensed the upheaval instantly, and now the giant types fiercely compete against one another, striving to create a new ordning through their deeds and accomplishments. These giants' calamitous endeavors have not only put the settlements of humans and other small folk in jeopardy but also attracted the attention of the giants' ancient enemies\u2014the dragons\u2014who will not abide the rise of another giant empire.",
								"Small folk can only speculate as to the cause of the giants' unrest. It remains to be seen whether the old ordning between the giant types will be restored, or whether a new hierarchy will replace the old one, knocking the storm giants from their lofty perch.",

								"Prior to the shattering of the ordning, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} was arguably the most powerful of all storm giants. From Maelstrom, his citadel deep within the Trackless Sea, he presided over a court that included representatives of every race of giant, from mighty storm giants to lowly hill giants. He used the power of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}\u2014a gift given to him by his wife\u2014to keep the more unruly giants in line.",
								"For as long as Hekaton had reigned, fear of the king's wrath and respect for the ordning was enough to keep lesser giants from rising up against him. But in recent years, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} had become convinced that the age of the giants was past, as evidenced by the growing distance between the giants and their gods. Annam the All-Father didn't answer prayers, and his divine offspring\u2014the lesser giant gods\u2014were out of touch, constantly waging war against one another on the Outer Planes. Hekaton came to believe that the giants were no longer the rightful masters of the world.",
								"Then, several months ago, Hekaton's fear became reality when the ordning was shattered. The king was profoundly shaken by the realization that storm giants might lose their apex status among giants. In the aftermath of the upheaval, he did his utmost to hold his court together, bullying weaker giants into submission.",
								"Hekaton's wife, Queen Neri, was particularly fond of the small folk. She visited them often in the years before the ordning was sundered, rising up out of the sea to meet them on the shores of the Sword Coast. Neri continually urged her husband to respect the civilizations of the small folk and leave them alone, if he could not countenance forming alliances with them. Hekaton, inherently distrustful of the small folk, wanted nothing to do with them, but he respected his wife's desire to treat with them on occasion.",
								"Neri continued to visit the small folk from time to time even after the upheaval\u2014until the day came when she failed to return from one of her trips to the Sword Coast. Hekaton's younger brother, {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}, commander of the king's garrison, found Neri's corpse shortly thereafter on a small island where she had been known to meet with humans. It was clear that she had been killed by small folk, and Hekaton wept for days before threatening to unleash his vengeance on the unsuspecting coastal territories.",
								"Uthor couldn't calm his brother's rage, so he turned to {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT}, the king's youngest daughter, for help. {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}, who shared her mother's affection for small folk and who stood next in line to inherit the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}, urged her father to uncover the truth before lashing out at anyone he encountered. Hekaton was swayed by his daughter's levelheadedness and wisdom, and once his hurricane-like anger ran its course, he set out to learn how his wife met her end. Unfortunately for the king, he was blind to enemies not only in his court but also in his family.",
								"The seeds of discontent in Hekaton's family were sown more than a year before the ordning was shattered, when the king divined that his two eldest daughters, {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT}, were unfit to rule, and saw signs that pointed to {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}, his youngest daughter, as his most worthy successor. {@creature Mirran|SKT} was tempestuous and prone to emotional outbursts, while {@creature Nym|SKT} was the opposite\u2014as cold and unloving as the sea. While Hekaton adored them both, he doubted their ability to keep the lesser giants in line, so he named {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} as his heir apparent.",
								"{@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} abided by his decision, but nevertheless their unhappiness was clear. Secretly, they blamed their mother for persuading their father to pass them over. Their blame was unfounded, in fact; Queen Neri had actually warned her husband against making any such pronouncement. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} seethed inside but were too terrified of their father to do anything, until a recent arrival to Maelstrom named {@creature Iymrith|SKT} wormed her way into Hekaton's court and goaded them into action.",
								"The elder sisters, acting in accordance with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s counsel, are responsible for both Neri's death and Hekaton's disappearance. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} got their revenge against Neri by plotting\u2014with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s help\u2014to have her assassinated. Then they urged their father to hunt down the small folk who killed their mother and fed him false information on the whereabouts of the assassins, to throw the king off track and put him in peril.",
								"In the wake of Hekaton's disappearance, turmoil engulfed his court. After nearly a month of waiting for him to come back, {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} reluctantly claimed her father's throne at {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}'s urging.",

The psychic abilities of the kraken are so great that it can reach out to creatures on land up and down the Sword Coast. Over the years, it has telepathically lured exiles, outcasts, and lost souls to its organization with the promise of a better life. Its agents are evil and grasping. When they are not gathering information for the kraken, they lurk in the shadows and indulge in activities befitting their evil nature.",

When {@creature Iymrith|SKT} reached out to its agents for assistance, {@creature Slarkrethel|SKT} instructed its devotees to humor the dragon by capturing Hekaton, the storm giant king, after slaying his queen. {@creature Iymrith|SKT} wants Hekaton kept alive so that he can't be resurrected and so that he can be held for ransom if her plans are thwarted.",

								"The adventure begins with {@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}. The adventurers arrive at the fortified village of Nightstone, shortly after a cloud giant attack. After securing the settlement, the characters locate several missing villagers in a monster-infested cave complex north of the village. The chapter concludes with the characters rescuing the villagers and gaining a quest that leads them to one of three locations: Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar. {@creature Zephyros|SKT}, a friendly cloud giant wizard, offers to transport them to their destination with the aid of his flying tower. En route, the characters fend off a group of evil air cultists as well as a Lords' Alliance strike team that mistakes {@creature Zephyros|SKT} for a hostile threat. After delivering the characters to their intended destination, {@creature Zephyros|SKT} bids the party farewell before taking his leave.",
								"In {@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}, the characters defend Bryn Shander, Goldenfields, or Triboar against a giant attack. Quests gained at the end of the battle prompt them to explore more of the Savage Frontier. The characters eventually cross paths with another friendly giant: a frost giant adventurer named {@creature Harshnag|SKT}. These events are described in {@adventure chapter 3|SKT|3}.",
								"In {@adventure chapter 4|SKT|4}, {@creature Harshnag|SKT} leads the characters to a temple under the Spine of the World, wherein they consult a divine oracle. The oracle requires that the adventurers retrieve some lost relics buried under Uthgardt ancestral mounds scattered throughout the North. If the adventurers complete the oracle's quest, it tells them what must be done to end the giant threat. As the characters leave the temple for the last time, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} appears and attacks them. {@creature Harshnag|SKT} holds the ancient blue dragon at bay while the adventurers escape with or without the aid of mysterious dragon cultists and an airship.",
								"Chapters 5 through 9 describe the lairs of five giant lords threatening the North. Players choose which giant lord they wish to confront. This villain has a {@item conch of teleportation|SKT} that the characters need to reach Maelstrom, a storm giant stronghold in the depths of the Trackless Sea. {@adventure Chapter 10|SKT|11} describes the politically charged court of the storm giants and the challenges faced by its current ruler, {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT}.",
								"If the characters earn {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}'s trust, she tasks them with finding her father, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}. The search for Hekaton is handled in {@adventure chapter 11|SKT|12}. Once freed from captivity, he joins forces with the party to slay the dragon {@creature Iymrith|SKT} in {@adventure chapter 12|SKT|13}. If Hekaton survives this final battle, he reclaims his throne. Otherwise, his daughter {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} becomes queen. In either event, the storm giants forge an alliance with the small folk against the enemies of giantkind: dragons. This act might be enough to restore the ordning as it was, or the future of the ordning might remain an open question in your campaign.",
								"Once {@creature Iymrith|SKT} is defeated, the storm giants are happy to let the characters deal with the remaining evil giant lords as they see fit.",

Others might be willing to follow loose threads and stray from the main story, hoping to take the adventure in interesting new directions. The adventure allows for a fair amount of wandering. If you begin to think the party has wandered too far away from the main plot, you can use {@creature Harshnag|SKT} (see {@area chapter 3|287|x}) to help steer characters back to the main story.

Gurrash, the orc war chief, recently led an attack on the forest. Unfortunately for the orcs, the elves were ready for them. More than half of the orc horde perished, and the surviving orcs were forced to flee. Gurrash and several orcs escape out of the forest, make their way south, and stumble upon Nightstone. Knowing that the elves aren't far behind, Gurrash and his orcs try to fight their way into the village and make a stand there.",

Norgra is Gurrash's lieutenant and assumes command if the war chief dies.",

If the drawbridge is raised, the orcs swim across the moat and try to climb the palisade, with no success. After being thwarted by the palisade, Gurrash sends scouts downriver to find another point of entry. It takes these orcs 10 minutes to realize that they can enter the village through the gap in the palisade where the bridge ({@area area 11|060|x}) leads up to the keep. Once the orcs enter the village, they fight to the death and don't take prisoners. Because the orcs don't know what they're up against, characters can try to hide in the village and pick off a few orcs at a time. They can also retreat to the keep, which the orcs ignore.",
										"If the {@creature Orc||orcs} lose more than half their number without gaining a foothold in the village, the survivors flee into the surrounding hills. Once the {@creature Orc||orcs} are defeated, the characters can advance to 3rd level and head to the Dripping Caves to locate and retrieve the missing villagers.

There are four guards at each gate at any given time. Another eight guards are on patrol, moving between the stone watchtowers along the wall. Most of the guards are human, with a sprinkling of shield dwarves, half-orcs, and other races.",

Keep yer fingers and extremities under wraps, lest Auril bite them off! Mind yer tempers, and you'll be most welcome here! Brought goods to sell? The market lies straight ahead. Craving a warm drink? May I recommend a drop of Firebeard's Firebrandy, sold only at Kelvin's Comfort, located on yer right as you enter the market square!\" (If the characters arrive at a different gate, you can relocate Augrek to that gate.)"

The current castellan, a boorish twit named Hantanus Tarm (LN male Illuskan human {@creature noble}), is responsible for defending the gates but has no military experience. The gatehouse guards report to him, but his position is seen as mostly political and ceremonial, and he has no influence anywhere but at the gatehouse. The gatehouse is spacious enough to accommodate the members of all three shifts, and any attack on the gates brings the full force of the gatehouse staff to bear.",

Next to each pagoda are one or two stone outbuildings that serve as barracks. A 10-foot-wide, moss-covered stone staircase leads from the top of the parapet down to the compound.

Picking a door lock requires thieves' tools and a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity check. The rooms and cellars are packed with harvested fruit and vegetables in the fall and are empty by midwinter.",

Stationed at each post are thirty {@creature Scout||scouts} (NG males and females of various races and ethnicities) two-thirds of whom are on duty at any given time. The rest are asleep in their bunks. Of the twenty scouts on duty, twelve are stationed on the parapet, spread hundreds of yards apart and looking outward for signs of trouble. The other eight patrol the adjacent walls in pairs.",
										"The watch posts are far enough apart that shouts of alarm are ineffective. If a watch post needs to sound an alarm, a guard runs to the pagoda and strikes the gong with a heavy mallet. The pagodas are designed to amplify sound, allowing the ringing of each gong to be heard as far as two miles away. Any other watch posts within that range ring their gongs as well, putting more of the compound on alert.",
										"The watch posts were designed to warn Goldenfields of approaching armies and dragons. Even though the watch posts and the wall patrols provide a great measure of security, a small group of invaders could scale the outer wall and enter the compound undetected if they were lucky enough to avoid the notice of the guards."

Every midwinter, the guild sends one of its members to Goldenfields as a sign of its commitment to protecting Waterdeep's interests. The wizard serves for one year and acts as a liaison between the city and the abbot, while also aiding in the defense of Goldenfields. The guild's current attaché is {@creature Naxene Drathkala|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix D|SKT|16|Appendix D: Special NPCs}), a quiet and bookish young woman who lives in a lavishly furnished suite above the inn's stable house and spends most of her time writing papers on subjects both arcane and esoteric.

								"Guh, the self-styled chief of the hill giants, has driven off her female rivals and conquered their husbands. Now, she tasks her mates with collecting food for her voracious appetite. Two of these big dummies, Lob and Ogg, wandered the hills and valleys south of Grudd Haug, the den of Guh's tribe. They eventually blundered into the Forlorn Hills and, a few weeks ago, stumbled upon a gang of bugbears and goblins. The goblinoids told Lob and Ogg about a large farm on the far side of the Dessarin River. It occurred to the hill giants that they should attack it. So, the giants waded across the river and hurled rocks at Goldenfields, pounding its outer wall and alarming its residents. Archers on the wall retaliated with a barrage of arrows. The giants and goblinoids withdrew to nurse their wounds, leaving Goldenfields' defenders to wonder when the next attack would come. The attack hasn't changed the mood among the residents, who place great stock in the strength of their outer defenses and militia.",

When they got there, they told Guh about the \"big farm.\" Guh dispatched a horde of hill giants, ogres, bugbears, and goblins to pillage it. With Lob and Ogg leading the way, the horde got lost in the hills and blundered into a copper dragon's territory. Many giants, ogres, bugbears, and goblins died that day. The survivors fled, only to stumble into an Uthgardt barbarian ambush. At that point, it became clear to those who remained alive that Lob and Ogg were poor guides and detrimental to the success of the mission. The bugbears took over from there, leading the remnants of the horde to Goldenfields, with Lob and Ogg bringing up the rear and blaming one another for their misadventures.",

Koggin would do it himself, but he thinks that the adventurers stand a better chance of persuading the Snail to relent. Nelkin is described in the \"Daggerford\" section in chapter 3.

						"The bustling mercantile town of Triboar stands where the Long Road meets the Evermoor Way. Triboar's name is thought to have come from a traveler's tale of slaying three boars here in the same day, over four hundred winters ago. The town is built on flat, fertile land, with a few natural rises here and there. Nearly half of Triboar's population lives outside the town proper, on sprawling ranches and neighboring farmsteads, most of which lie to the north or east.",
						"The current lord protector of Triboar is a good-natured Harper and ex-adventurer named {@creature Darathra Shendrel|SKT}. Darathra enacts and modifies local laws (known as \"the Lord's Decree\"), which are then enforced by the Twelve\u2014a squad of a dozen mounted warriors drawn from the militia.",
						"Triboar is a market for the horses raised by nearby ranches. Blacksmiths, harness-makers, and wagonworks also flourish in town. In addition, a number of guides operate out of Triboar. They take merchants and other travelers all over the Sword Coast, typically for stiff fees.",

Human settlements rely on various industries for survival. For example, most of the humans of Ten-Towns and Port Llast are fishers, the humans of Mirabar and Leilon are primarily miners, and the humans who live in Beliard, Triboar, and other settlements of the central Dessarin Valley are mostly farmers.

Members of the Lords' Alliance include the cities of Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Mirabar, Yartar, and Silverymoon, as well as the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle and the dwarfhold of Mithral Hall.

Small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few if any nonhumans, with most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferring to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands. In generations past, most human settlers of the North were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the Savage Frontier have attracted distant foreigners, and several generations of cultural intermingling have given the humans of the North much more diversity in their appearance (see \"{@race human||Human Names and Ethnicities}\" in {@book chapter 2|PHB|1} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB})."

The children often climb it themselves and cling precariously to the high, tilted saddle, waving their arms and commanding imaginary armies into battle. Within spitting distance of the statue is the Stag-Horned Flagon, a cozy tavern run by an gray-haired, middle-aged woman with a wry sense of humor named Arleosa Starhenge (NG female Chondathan human {@creature commoner}). Born in a wild magic zone, Arleosa has the innate magical ability to cast the {@spell alter self} spell three times per day.

								"Citadel Adbar has stood in the bitter cold of the Ice Mountains for almost eighteen centuries, impregnable and defiant. The fortress, carved out of a mountain spur, consists of two great towers ringed with spikes to keep large flying creatures from landing to attack the structures directly. The great chimney of the citadel's central foundry stands between the towers, belching smoke like a volcano about to erupt. Ringing the citadel is a host of platforms, battlements, and arrow slits from where defenders can fire crossbows at foolish attackers. A great drawbridge allows no one to enter the dwarven enclave except patrols and honored guests. Cleverly hidden traps await those who storm the halls uninvited, and beneath the citadel is an expansive network of tunnels and caverns designed to confuse would-be invaders. If Adbar's defenses should ever prove inadequate, the dwarves have created a secret evacuation tunnel that stretches for hundreds of miles, connecting to passages that lie under Citadel Felbarr to the west. Adbar's garrison offers a reward of 10 gp for each orc head brought to the city gates, or 100 gp for each giant head.",
								"The population of Citadel Adbar was severely depleted by the War of the Silver Marches, which drew away many of Adbar's greatest warriors, including its long-ruling king, Harbromm. King Harbromm led his knights into battle against the orc hordes invading the Marches and died on the field. Harbromm's twin sons, Bromm and Harnoth, inherited the throne and, like their father, left Citadel Adbar to join the war. Bromm later perished, leaving the crown to Harnoth. Harnoth and his followers fought many battles during the war, but the new king made some poor decisions that winnowed the once-great Knights of the Mithral Shield down to a handful of members. Fortunately for Harnoth, the Iron Guard\u2014Citadel Adbar's defending army\u2014remains strong.",
								"What's not generally known is that Harnoth, too, was killed by orcs toward the end of the war. To prevent political turmoil in Citadel Abdar, the elders of Adbar's dwarven clans hired a {@creature doppelganger} to impersonate King Harnoth. True power in Citadel Adbar now lies with the clan elders, who meet in secret and tell their \"king\" what to do and say before every one of his public appearances. The doppelganger is so smitten with its role that it sometimes forgets itself and makes decisions that the elders haven't approved, behavior that is a growing cause of concern for some.",

East of Yartar, the road becomes a gravel and dirt wagon trail that passes a little too close to the Evermoors for most merchants' comfort. Between Olostin's Hold and Everlund, the trail passes through an area that used to be forest and is now full of tree stumps. Efforts to turn this long stretch into a proper road have long been thwarted by disagreements between the leaders of Yartar and Everlund, and Everlund's exit from the Lords' Alliance has dashed all hope."

								"Long ago, a meteor strike blasted a crater in the frozen tundra near the coast of the Trackless Sea, shearing away tons of rock and exposing rich veins of copper and silver ore. In the years that followed, miners settled nearby, giving rise to the town of Fireshear. The miners work for a consortium of three allied merchant companies: Hammaver House (based in Mirabar), the Silver Triangle (based in Neverwinter), and the Delvers of Brokenstone (based in Waterdeep). The settlement is made up of squat stone structures that resemble igloos, their domes good at supporting the weight of snow and deflecting the cold wind. Most homes are dug out of the rock and include deep cellars laden with preserves.",
								"The miners of Fireshear dwell here all year. Ramps carved into the cliffs lead down to the shore, where stone docks protrude into a shallow bay that freezes by late fall and doesn't thaw until early summer. Fireshear imports most of its food, clothing, and other necessities. Ice fishing is a popular pastime among children, but all able-bodied adults are expected to toil in the mines.",
								"The town has three leaders, who form a ruling triumvirate that handles trade negotiations with representatives of other settlements and disperses supplies among the townsfolk. Each member is a representative of one of the town's founding companies. Triumvirate members serve for life or until they resign, and they are known to take bribes, rewarding families who pay them in coin or precious ore with supplies of higher quality or in greater quantity. The current members are Tharkus Gromm (NE male shield dwarf {@creature thug}) of Hammaver House; Darva (NG female dragonborn {@creature mage}) of the Silver Triangle; and Zalaron Daska (N male Tethyrian human {@creature veteran}) of the Delvers of Brokenstone.",

She lives north of town, in a mostly underground hovel on a ridge that overlooks the sea. Locals know that Dasharra raises griffons, trains them as mounts, and teaches people how to ride them. The griffons are kept in a low, sturdy wooden shelter next to her home. At any time, Dasharra has {@dice 1d4 + 6} adult {@creature Griffon||griffons} and {@dice 1d4} griffon eggs in her care.

Otherwise, they must pay for her services. She charges 250 gp per person for training and another 25 gp per person per day of travel. Characters who want to be trained must undergo three days of intense lessons, after which they know enough about griffon riding to control their mounts. Each griffon is able to carry one Medium rider or two Small riders (along with their armor and portable gear), and Dasharra has saddles and reins sized for both Small and Medium riders. Dasharra's \"alpha griffon,\" Screecher, allows no one but her to ride it.

Some who ventured to Noanar's Hold never returned, spurring dark rumors that the five Hunt Lords who ruled Noanar's Hold were arranging wanton slaughters to amuse their guests and even allowing their guests to hunt one another. The place was shunned, and the village fell on hard times. Any character who has proficiency in the {@skill History} skill can recall these dark rumors with a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill History}) check. A successful check also confirms that the Hunt Lords were human.",

A century and a half ago, to escape their inevitable deaths, the Hunt Lords forged a pact with Orcus, who transformed them into five {@creature Wight||wights}. Necromancers in the demon lord's service helped the Hunt Lords turn the inanimate bones of their long-dead horses into five animated {@creature Warhorse Skeleton||warhorse skeletons}.

They always return to their keep before sunrise the following morning. They have no interest in harming the local villagers, whom they view as their subjects. The villagers are well aware of the Hunt Lords' escapades, but Noanar's Hold is so isolated that few others know that the Hunt Lords still exist. A handful of villagers have moved away from Noanar's Hold over the years, but most are too frightened to flee, believing the rumors (although they are false) that the Hunt Lords track down and kill villagers who try to leave. Today, residents of Noanar's Hold rarely stray far from their homes. They don't speak of the Hunt Lords, nor do they warn visitors away.

If a creature attunes to the greatclub, it magically shrinks to a size that the creature can wield effectively.

While the {@spell hallucinatory terrain} spell is in effect, the garden looks as it did in its heyday, with statues of frolicking dryads and satyrs situated among the flowers and stone benches. A cantankerous old Harper named Kolbaz (NG male Calishite human {@creature mage}) dwells in the villa and renews the {@spell hallucinatory terrain} spell every day at highsun (he has that spell prepared instead of {@spell ice storm}). He uses his cantrips to frighten away squatters and other unwanted intruders."

								"Fate brings the characters into contact with {@creature Harshnag|SKT} the Grim, a legendary good-aligned frost giant. In taverns throughout the North, he is known as a monster to some and a hero to others. In Waterdeep, he's remembered as the largest member of Force Grey, a notoriously destructive adventuring company that came to the city's defense on more than one occasion. Believed to be hundreds of years old, {@creature Harshnag|SKT} wanders the wilderness with greataxe in hand, seeking to lay low his evil giant brethren.",

What's important is that he knows that the ordning has been broken, that the storm giants no longer have the power to keep the smaller giants in check, and that {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} has gone missing. He aims to protect the North from the depredations of evil giants while seeking out adventurers who share this goal. By the time the characters meet him, he has already slaughtered a few giants.",

He's a giant of few words who prefers to let his actions do his talking. When he does speak outside of combat, he comes across as surprisingly calm and soft-spoken. While swinging his axe in battle, however, he bellows and laughs like a berserker. In the company of small adventurers, he tries not to dominate social situations or make too many decisions for them, because he knows how fragile and inflated their egos can be.",
								"{@creature Harshnag|SKT} knows the North well and has no chance of becoming lost in its wilderness. He's sensitive to the fact that many small folk have a freshly rekindled fear of giants striding into their settlements. As a result, if the characters visit a settlement while {@creature Harshnag|SKT} is with them, he prefers to remain unseen on the outskirts. The exception is Waterdeep; he considers that city his home and has no qualms about entering it, gently brushing aside guards who stand in his way.",

If the characters defeat Guh and obtain her {@item conch of teleportation|SKT}, they can use it to teleport to Maelstrom, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s undersea citadel (see chapter 10, \"Hold of the Storm Giants\").

Others set out on their own, pillaging the countryside for anything edible.",
								"Farmers who live downriver from Grudd Haug have suffered the most from the giants' depredations. The first inkling of trouble was a sudden drop in the river's water level, caused by the dam-like structure of the hill giant den. Not long thereafter, Guh's husbands and their followers began plundering livestock from riverside farms, stealing trees from orchards, knocking down cottages, and snatching up folk who didn't run fast enough.",
								"So far, most of the hill giants' activities have been confined to the region of the Dessarin Valley closest to their den, but as food becomes scarce, Guh's husbands are forced to expand their efforts outward. The villages of Beliard, Womford, and Uluvin, as well as caravans traveling the Iron Road between Womford and Uluvin, are all within the hill giants' threat radius. Meanwhile, the female hill giants exiled by Guh have taken to the hills. They crave the return of their husbands, but they are neither strong enough nor shrewd enough to unseat Guh. They might be convinced to help adventurers overthrow her if it means they get to beat their husbands into submission once more. See the \"Old Tower\" section in chapter 3 for an example of a female hill giant outcast."

The lower level of the den is lodged between two rocky outcroppings and made of piled timber packed with clay and mud, with hollow cavities that resemble caves. Above this piled timber foundation is a mud steading (a house made to giant scale) with a log roof. The structure is an impressive feat of engineering, well beyond the ability of hill giants to fabricate on their own. In fact, Grudd Haug's design is the work of hobgoblin and goblin engineers, assembled with the might of hill giant and ogre laborers. East of the steading is a yard enclosed by a 20-foot-high palisade wall made of logs lashed together with thick twine.",

If the characters approach Deadstone Cleft in an airship and move into the roc's line of sight, the roc takes to the sky and attacks it. The airship can't outrun or outmaneuver the roc, which is too big to land on the deck or reach creatures on the deck with its claws. The roc can bite creatures on deck, but it prefers to attack the balloon itself (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4 for the balloon's statistics). If it successfully brings down the airship, the roc spends a few rounds picking through the wreckage in search of food before returning to its nest.

Characters who set out to find the ring for themselves will quickly hit one dead end after another. Even divination won't reveal the ring's current whereabouts. Over the years, various Harpers have dedicated resources toward finding Artus Cimber and the ring, to no avail. If the Harpers catch wind of the characters' attempts to locate Artus and the ring, they try to discourage any such pursuit.

						"In the age when giants ruled the North, Svardborg was a remote village where frost giants came to hunt whales and giant walruses. It was abandoned after the empire of Ostoria fell and, over time, drifted northward and became entombed in ice. Today, Svardborg floats amid hundreds of other icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Three of the lodges are still entombed in ice, while the others have been chipped out of the ice and rendered habitable. The expansion and contraction of the ice over the centuries damaged the lodges, and repairs to them are under way. {@creature Jarl Storvald|SKT} has sent ships to the mainland to gather the wood needed to make repairs.",

Stretched across the passage is a gate in the form of a net of thick iron chains. The giants lower the chains into the water to let their ships pass through. A small vessel, such as a rowboat sized for humans, can slip through the net even while the gate is raised. Ships bigger than a rowboat are too large to pass through the gate when it is raised.",

Raw iron ore from the mines are brought by cart to {@area area 17|3eb|x} and loaded into iron buckets hanging from a carousel-like apparatus called a bucket chain. This bucket chain is turned by a slave wheel ({@area area 20|3f1|x}) and moves clockwise through the upper level of the fortress, transporting the iron ore to the dressing mill ({@area area 12|3df|x}) to be broken up. Iron ore is then loaded into buckets and transported to the foundry, where ogres on the gantries ({@area area 18|3ed|x}) use long, hooked poles to tip the buckets, causing the ore to fall into the smelters below ({@area area 34|411|x}). Enormous bellows raise the temperature inside the smelters, melting the iron. The molten iron spills into a huge stone trough ({@area area 35|412|x}), where it is channeled into molds and used to forge giant-sized swords and armor.",
										"The iron buckets are spaced 10 feet apart. Each one is 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. A bucket can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium creatures. Two Small creatures can take the place of one Medium creature. While the slave wheel is turning, the buckets move at a speed of 10 feet per round; it takes a bucket roughly 15 minutes to complete one circuit.",
										"Although the adamantine forge ({@area area 29|408|x}) isn't lit, the main foundry ({@area area 34|411|x}) is operational, and the racket from the weapon forges and the slowly revolving bucket chain echoes throughout the complex. The noise is so loud that activity in one area usually doesn't draw the attention of creatures in adjacent areas, making it possible for adventurers to eliminate foes a few at a time.",
										"If the slave wheel stops turning, the bucket chain stops; this is a sign to the fire giants that something is amiss. Unless the buckets start moving again, all adult fire giants that haven't been killed or {@condition incapacitated} head toward the slave wheel to find out what the problem is unless the Ironslag Roster table says otherwise."
