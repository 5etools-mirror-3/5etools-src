						"In decades past, the vampire Gunthar the Gluttonous terrorized the people of Goldenwheat. Gunthar and his three faithful hounds threatened to drink the farmers and their livestock dry. When all hope seemed lost, a group of brave heroes slew Gunthar in his crypt and plunged a stake into his heart. They left the crypt victorious, sealing the crypt behind them and leaving a stake buried in the vampire's corpse.",
						"Over time, the blood-soaked stake warped and sprouted a Gulthias tree, a plant infused with evil essence. Malignance spreads from this tree, destroying crops, corrupting soil, and spawning awakened plants with a taste for blood. The tree's evil was contained for a time within Gunthar's crypt, and farms flourished in a land the vampire had filled with despair\u2014until now.",
						"An ankheg hungry for local livestock recently tunneled into Gunthar's crypt. The Gulthias tree's roots reached into the ankheg's tunnels, infecting them with blights and fungi and spoiling the crops above. The tree's vile tendrils even worked their way into the corpses of Gunthar's hounds. Returned to life and mutated by the tree, these bloodthirsty dogs loyally guard their master's resting place and destroy any who threaten the Gulthias tree.",
						"A local farmer has reached out to the characters, hoping they can put an end to the blight affecting his crops and those of other nearby farms. If the disease continues to spread, the ensuing food shortage could prove disastrous.",
