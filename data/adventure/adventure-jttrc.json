Embarking on the adventures of the Radiant Citadel will expand your gaming horizons, can give your characters new perspectives, and might change the way you look at fantasy tropes and traditions. As adventures are the lens through which we explore fantastic worlds, they shape who our characters are and what they believe in. The greater the variety adventures offer, the richer our characters and, by extension, our gaming experiences.",

In the depths of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel lay dormant and abandoned by all but the Incarnates of the Preserve of the Ancestors. Yet it was undiminished in its grandeur, waiting for its inheritors to reawaken its power for a new era.",

						"Some scholars studying the Radiant Citadel's origins posit that the Citadel is a relic of the mythical First World and was a vital center of diplomacy between great cultures before a cataclysm shattered that world. Others speculate that it was a fortress, a refuge, or even a weapon in a war that transpired in the last days of the First World. Thus far, the Dawn Incarnates have declined to answer scholars' questions on the subject.",

It was named in her honor, with Citlán roughly translating to \"the place near Citlali.\" People began calling the skeletal figure La Catrina for her elegant clothing.",

They and their people were starving by the time they arrived at a peaceful but infertile land. The lovers offered themselves to the land, fusing their souls to create the two oldest volcanoes in what is now Tletepec, but the land remained barren. Desperate, the people offered everything they had to the spirits in the volcanoes, even the last of their food. The spirits accepted this offering in the name of the gods and blessed the land. Since then, the people of Tletepec have offered a portion of what they have to the volcanoes to maintain these blessings.",

Legends say that the violence persisted for a century, until the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings who had founded Great Xing returned.

This dwarf became the Yellow Dragon Emperor, founder of the nation's first ruling dynasty.",

								"Ataguans dream vividly of a great tepui\u2014a tabletop mountain surrounded by jungle. Though the site is unseen and unreachable, many claim the shared experience of having explored the mesa in their dreams, seeing others like themselves in passing, and meeting otherworldly beings.",
								"The secret behind these dreams is found in the oldest legends, which speak of the Ghost Orchid Tepui existing simultaneously in the Llanos and in the Feywild, parallel to Atagua. The source of the dreams is a powerful crystal called the Sleeping Stone, which many who dream have seen, alongside magical white orchids growing in the crystalline caverns below the tepui's summit.",
								"As counterpoint to these bright dreams, sinister creatures haunt the history of Atagua. During the war of independence, rattling whistles rose from the Llanos at night. As the fighting increased, the whistling manifested near villages and haciendas, inspiring nightmares or incurable despair for those who survived hearing it. Some reported seeing hunched giants from the corner of the eye\u2014a new threat to terrorize a war-weary people.",
								"When the fighting ended and Atagua was free once more, the nightmares ended. The menacing whistlers were largely forgotten as the peoples of Atagua embraced peace and reconstruction. But even today, whistlers occasionally appear in the Llanos, evidence that the Far Realm still influences the land. And some among the Green Doctors whisper that Atagua might yet face an invasion by those terrors."
