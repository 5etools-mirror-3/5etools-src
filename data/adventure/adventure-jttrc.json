Embarking on the adventures of the Radiant Citadel will expand your gaming horizons, can give your characters new perspectives, and might change the way you look at fantasy tropes and traditions. As adventures are the lens through which we explore fantastic worlds, they shape who our characters are and what they believe in. The greater the variety adventures offer, the richer our characters and, by extension, our gaming experiences.",

For millennia, the dragons of her lineage had recounted tales of its glory. As threats loomed on the horizon, {@creature Sholeh|JttRC} looked to the legend of the Radiant Citadel as salvation.",

Their travels took them across perilous planes and to distant worlds, and many died or gave up in despair. Only a quarter of the heroes who set out completed {@creature Sholeh|JttRC}'s quest, but the adventurers' sacrifices were rewarded. In the depths of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel lay dormant and abandoned by all but the Incarnates of the Preserve of the Ancestors. Yet it was undiminished in its grandeur, waiting for its inheritors to reawaken its power for a new era.",

						"Some scholars studying the Radiant Citadel's origins posit that the Citadel is a relic of the mythical First World and was a vital center of diplomacy between great cultures before a cataclysm shattered that world. Others speculate that it was a fortress, a refuge, or even a weapon in a war that transpired in the last days of the First World. Thus far, the Dawn Incarnates have declined to answer scholars' questions on the subject.",

It was named in her honor, with Citlán roughly translating to \"the place near Citlali.\" People began calling the skeletal figure La Catrina for her elegant clothing.",

Desperate, the people offered everything they had to the spirits in the volcanoes, even the last of their food. The spirits accepted this offering in the name of the gods and blessed the land. Since then, the people of Tletepec have offered a portion of what they have to the volcanoes to maintain these blessings.",

Then the elven leader Kubjhatika killed a giant mollusk that attacked her people. After the battle, she carved the tale of her victory and her people's journey on a beautiful, red-ridged shell. This shell became the Riverine's Shankha. Kubjhatika offered it as tribute to the riverines, appealing to them for refuge amid the unforgiving land.",

Trees and flowers erupt from the stony ground, and the air is filled with the scent of plum blossoms. For a moment, the garden is magically restored to its ancient splendor, but after 1 minute this vibrancy vanishes and the area returns to normal.

If the characters haven't discovered the magical features of the throne in area Y3, she also shows them how to access the hidden chamber below.

Legends say that the violence persisted for a century, until the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings who had founded Great Xing returned.

This dwarf became the Yellow Dragon Emperor, founder of the nation's first ruling dynasty.",

That realm's serpentine protector, the spirit Chimagua, was fond of mortals and would bestow visions upon the folk of Atagua. However, when Atagua fell to invaders from a distant land, visions from Chimagua ended. The sages known as the Green Doctors sought to reconnect the land to the Feywild, but their attempts failed and weakened the planar fabric around Atagua. Soon, the region's people began experiencing terrible nightmares that gradually began manifesting in the form of terrifying creatures connected to an inscrutable Far Realm entity known as the Drought Elder. Horrified by their mistake, the Green Doctors scrambled to push back the eldritch creatures with a hastily woven magical ward.",
						"Today, though Atagua is independent again, its magical ward has finally collapsed. The influence of the Drought Elder seeps in to Atagua once more. For years, this corruption has manifested only as dreams or the rare otherworldly predator, but recently more beings from the Far Realm have begun to slip into Atagua. Only the return of the spirit Chimagua might save the land, but all is not as it should be at the Ghost Orchid Tepui. Unless Atagua's ancient connection to the Feywild is restored, creatures from the Far Realm will overrun the land.",

								"The secret behind these dreams is found in the oldest legends, which speak of the Ghost Orchid Tepui existing simultaneously in the Llanos and in the Feywild, parallel to Atagua. The source of the dreams is a powerful crystal called the Sleeping Stone, which many who dream have seen, alongside magical white orchids growing in the crystalline caverns below the tepui's summit.",
								"As counterpoint to these bright dreams, sinister creatures haunt the history of Atagua. During the war of independence, rattling whistles rose from the Llanos at night. As the fighting increased, the whistling manifested near villages and haciendas, inspiring nightmares or incurable despair for those who survived hearing it. Some reported seeing hunched giants from the corner of the eye\u2014a new threat to terrorize a war-weary people.",
								"When the fighting ended and Atagua was free once more, the nightmares ended. The menacing whistlers were largely forgotten as the peoples of Atagua embraced peace and reconstruction. But even today, whistlers occasionally appear in the Llanos, evidence that the Far Realm still influences the land. And some among the Green Doctors whisper that Atagua might yet face an invasion by those terrors."
