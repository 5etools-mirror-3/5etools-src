After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.",
						"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society\u2014a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.",
						"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!"

If Red deals the gem 4 or more damage, then the gem breaks and Elowen howls in despair. The gem can ultimately be fixed if the pieces are taken back to {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}, but he panics when he first sees the gem, before remembering he knows a wizard who can help him restore it. Hitting the gem with a padded arrow knocks the gem toward the edge. Have the player roll a {@dice d6}. On a 1\u20134 the gem flies outside the red circle, on a 5 or 6, the gem falls inside the circle where Red can hit it again.",
