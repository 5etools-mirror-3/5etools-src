										"At some points in a D&D game, you might have a challenge that is not a combat but is still tense and exciting. In this case, the characters need to quickly repair the silver bowl before the magical spirit that inhabits it perishes.",
										"The characters might come up with unique ways to try to help repair the bowl. Try to use these ideas to tell the story of the bowl's repair. As the players brainstorm their ideas, engage them in a discussion. If the idea is preposterous, like smashing the bowl against the floor to fix it, it's okay to say the idea won't work. However, it's better to work with the players by figuring out how a similar action might work. Instead of smashing it, for example, a character might use their Strength to pound the dent back into shape. That is a similar idea that helps work toward the best outcome.",

Instead of just having a combat, roleplaying, or ability checks, scenes can do several of them at once. This scene provides that potential. As the characters attempt to repair the bowl and save the Spirit of the Bowl, Vonnet and Dilly can try to grab it and run. This might mean some characters need to fight the bandits to get the bowl back in time for the others to repair it."
