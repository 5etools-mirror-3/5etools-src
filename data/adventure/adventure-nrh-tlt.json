After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.",

All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society\u2014a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.",
