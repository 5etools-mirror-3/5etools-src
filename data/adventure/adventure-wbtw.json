These hags are the adoptive sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&D's past and a key player in the adventure's unfolding drama. Using an artifact called {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}, the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters' world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} and {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}, who can help or hinder the characters' efforts to reach Prismeer.",

The letter describes the kinship between this wizard and the adventuring party to which Madryck once belonged. It concludes with, \"By the terms of a magically binding agreement, the bearer of this letter is owed one favor from Saya Kalternax or, in the event of their untimely demise, one of Saya's devoted apprentices.\" Although Saya died a few years ago, this letter can be presented to one of their apprentices (who might be difficult to locate, at your discretion). Examples of an appropriate favor would be the brewing of a rare or uncommon potion, the scribing of a rare or uncommon scroll, or the loan of a spellbook containing a selection of wizard spells of 5th level and lower. If you need statistics for this spellcaster, use the {@creature mage} stat block. Give the mage whatever alignment and languages you like.",
