						"More than one thousand years ago, the wizard {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) journeyed from a distant land to the base of Mount Waterdeep, perhaps acceding to the whispered summons of providence. Some believe he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as the Cradlelands. In ages past, humanity spread from the Cradlelands across Faer√ªn, originating from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland birthed out of a conflict with the gods. Others give Halaster less ancient origins, placing him among the early wizards of Netheril, or asserting that he came from a southern nation long since buried by sand and time. Whatever his origin, scholars have recorded that Halaster brought with him seven apprentices to Mount Waterdeep.",
						"With the Seven guarding his back, Halaster tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all other wizard's towers. But as the seasons wore on, the Seven saw less and less of their enigmatic master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from distant planes for tunneling and other construction beneath his tower, and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the Seven. Eventually, Halaster's exploration broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the dwarves around a mithral mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The architects of the Underhalls, the Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, and warring duergar and drow had settled in the ruins. Halaster began a crusade against both the drow and the duergar, participating in wild hunts with extraplanar allies through the tunnels. The stubborn duergar dug in until the mithral was largely mined out; then they abandoned the Underhalls, leaving the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. The Mad Mage rounded up the remaining dark elves, trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic, while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others. Once he had wrung the drow of their usefulness, {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} tunneled on, ever downward, indulging his inexplicable compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain.",
						"Using his underground complex as a base of operations, Halaster traveled to other planes and distant lands, collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners, servants, or guardians in Undermountain. Populating and defending the dungeon became an obsession. Over time, the mage's preoccupation with Undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness.",
						"Halaster's apprentices came and went. Some left only to return\u2014inexplicably drawn down into Undermountain's depths. Others remained by his side. As they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions, madness settled into their souls as well.",
						"During the years Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep developed in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep and spread down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward over the years, it came to surround the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to those early settlers, and they often sent criminals into its endless depths as punishment. So it was for many years, until an intrepid adventurer named Durnan delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive, laden with riches and countless harrowing tales. Durnan used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of Halaster's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into Undermountain, and call it the Yawning Portal. Durnan owns and operates the inn and tavern to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their mettle in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage.",

								"Where Waterdeep stands today, there once stood Aelinthaldaar, the capital city of the ancient elven kingdom of Illefarn. When the elves left, they used a powerful spell to erase all traces of their capital. This spell had the unintended side effect of creating a permanent knot in the Weave, the fabric through which all magic is channeled. This knot lies deep underground and isn't something that can be seen, felt, or undone, but it can cause madness to bloom in the minds of mortal beings who dwell near it for too long. The knot permeates Undermountain, and the madness it causes typically manifests as an obsession with the dungeon itself. Those affected by the knot in the Weave exhibit a subconscious desire to remain in or near the dungeon. Halaster and several of his apprentices fell prey to this obsession, as did many Melairkyn dwarves and Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Not all creatures that dwell in Undermountain succumb to its madness, and those who do aren't even aware that the dungeon has them in its clutches."

						"The Yawning Portal, a famous inn and tavern located near the eastern slope of Mount Waterdeep, derives its name from a 40-foot-diameter well that descends into the first level of Undermountain. Located in the center of the taproom, the well was once the outer shell of Halaster's mighty tower, which was demolished long ago. Its sheer walls are made of old mortared stones. Next to this gaping orifice hangs a winch with a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that Durnan, the proprietor, uses to lower adventurers down the shaft and (sometimes) pull them up again. Durnan controls the winch himself and will transport only one adventurer at a time. The trip takes 10 rounds, down and up. The rope is stained with old blood and long enough to reach all the way to the floor of the dark room at the bottom of the 140-foot shaft ({@area level 1, area 1|035|x}).",
						"Durnan charges adventurers 1 gp each to descend into the well, whether they opt to use the rope or not. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. He also readily accepts coin from patrons who want to place grisly bets on adventurers who dare explore Undermountain, and their odds of returning alive. \"Five gold dragons says they're back before a tenday, minus the fighter, the wizard, and the cleric!\" is the flavor of commentary often heard amid gales of drunken laughter.",

It's Lady Wylynd's recollection that a longtime ally of the Moonstar family, a bronze dragon named {@creature Glyster|WDMM}, was asked or told to find Vanrak and bring him back to Waterdeep to face justice. The dragon found Vanrak but could not wrest him from the depths of Undermountain. Instead, the dragon became corrupted by Shar's magic and was transformed into a shadow dragon named {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}.

Her happiness faded quickly when the dungeon proved to be a far cry from the woods she called home. Determined to keep {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} in Undermountain, Halaster used several {@spell wish} spells to create a magical forest for her, but even this gift wasn't enough to offset the druid's languor. When Yinark forbade her from ever returning to the surface, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} grew positively despondent. The relationship soured and turned violent. A volley of spells on both sides resulted in Yinark's death. After {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}'s fury abated, all that remained was undying grief and encroaching madness. She remains in Undermountain in accordance with Yinark's wishes, a prisoner of her own guilt.",

She can also summon six awakened trees from the forest with a whistle.",

If it is restored to full size in a space too small to contain it, such as this chamber, the ship splinters apart and is destroyed.

She is accompanied at all times by her shield guardian bodyguard (she wears its amulet), as well as a grell valet that carries her spellbook (which contains all the spells she has prepared).",

						"Adherents of Shar have been active in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep ever since a disastrous expedition to the Black Jungles mounted in the Year of the Dark Dawn (1104 DR) by Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a charismatic, outgoing swashbuckler. Vanrak was but a pale shadow of his former self when he returned. A few tendays later, his father, Lord Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange wasting disease that could not be cured by healing magic.",
						"Upon assuming leadership of House Moonstar, Vanrak publicly broke with the temple of Sel√ªne (god of the moon), which he blamed for his father's untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as Vanrak came to be known, secretly embraced Sel√ªne's sister: Shar, the Lady of Loss.",
						"By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House Moonstar was in open schism. Family members who still venerated Sel√ªne aligned themselves with Lord Vanrak's sister, Lady Alathene, and Sel√ªne's priesthood. Meanwhile, Lord Vanrak and his followers extended their dark influence over much of the city's harbor with the aid of a small army of mercenaries bolstered by followers of Shar.",
						"Lady Alathene appeared in open court and asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city. She also presented evidence of her brother's numerous crimes, including slavery, arson, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the immediate capture of the Dark Ranger, but by the time the City Watch had breached the gates of his villa, Vanrak and his followers had already fled through a secret portal into Undermountain. He and his followers remained there until, in the Year of the Dark Mask (1171 DR), they conquered the level of Undermountain that came to be known as Vanrakdoom.",
						"Operating from his new base, Vanrak extended his influence throughout much of Undermountain and even periodically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of Sel√ªne in the city above. He achieved his most dramatic success in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when his followers infiltrated the High House of Stars through its cellars, slaughtered most of the inhabitants before they could raise an alarm, engulfed the temple in black fire, and burned it to the ground. The invaders also acquired enough treasure from the temple vaults to fund Lord Vanrak's personal quest for immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger had transformed himself into a death knight.",
						"The Lords of Waterdeep didn't make things easy for Vanrak Moonstar in the years that followed. They hired waves of adventurers to descend into Undermountain to bring Vanrak and his followers to justice. Although none of these adventurers succeeded, they winnowed down Vanrak's army to the point where he could no longer threaten the city.",
						"{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} compounded Vanrak's woes by urging other Undermountain dwellers to invade Vanrakdoom from time to time. In a desperate move, the few remaining priests of Shar performed rituals to harness the despair of Vanrak's shadow dragon mount, {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}, and use him to transport Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. In the end, Halaster's magical hold over Undermountain proved too strong to overcome, yet a small section of Vanrakdoom crossed over into the Plane of Shadow and became ensconced there.",
						"Confronted by failure, Vanrak came to believe that Shar had deceived him and had orchestrated his downfall solely to spite her nemesis, Sel√ªne. Vanrak had lost his family, his title, and most of his army, and he was in danger of losing hold over his domain. In the Year of Silent Shadows (1436 DR), he renounced his faith in Shar and begged Sel√ªne's forgiveness for the destruction of her temple and its followers. In a desperate act of redemption, the death knight destroyed his undead form using a {@item sun blade}. A vampire cleric of Shar named {@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM} has ruled Vanrakdoom ever since.",
						"With the shadow of Vanrak faded from memory, House Moonstar has prospered. The Waterdavian family is currently overseen by the once shrewd but now senile Lady Wylynd Moonstar, a venerable human noblewoman who, by last estimate, is well over a century old. Although she has no children of her own, Wylynd is surrounded by distant relatives, including a savvy half-drow grandnephew named Helion Moonstar, whom she has chosen to be her heir. The family's business interests lie in cartography and exploration, and Wylynd has been known to fund expeditions to Undermountain from time to time for reasons she prefers to keep to herself."

								"The Shadowdusk family, like many other Waterdavian noble lineages, made its fortune in trading. Three sisters named Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra Shadowdusk became famous for sponsoring and then leading adventuring expeditions into Undermountain. One of the items they recovered from the dungeon was a tablet of black crystal that allowed contact with entities of the Far Realm. Their brother, Xerrion, came to possess the tablet and used it to contact otherworldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family's business rivals and political enemies. This contact drove Xerrion mad, and it didn't take long for the madness to spread to other members of the Shadowdusk family and come into public view. As the family's behavior grew more bizarre, local broadsheets circulated rumors that the Shadowdusks had been replaced by aberrant horrors in human guise. Their ancestral villa, Shadowdusk Hold, was burned to the ground in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR). The Waterdavian authorities who investigated the blaze never made their findings public, but the commonly held belief is that the city's Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors was responsible.",
								"All three of Xerrion's sisters were killed in the fire that consumed Shadowdusk Hold. Xerrion escaped and fled to his sisters' redoubt in the depths of Undermountain. From there, he used {@spell sending} spells to contact Shadowdusk family members living abroad and brought them to live with him in a twisted, underground version of Shadowdusk Hold. Among those who answered the call was Margaraste Shadowdusk, a distant cousin whom Xerrion would later marry.",
								"Level 22 of Undermountain became a safe haven where the Shadowdusks could treat with Far Realm horrors away from the prying eyes of their fellow Waterdavians. In the end, Xerrion and Margaraste stepped through a gateway into the Far Realm and were never seen again. In their absence, the torch of leadership passed to Xerrion's niece and nephew, Dezmyr and Zalthar\u2014the twin children of his late sister Yarlithra. These former paladins of Torm abandoned their faith long ago, becoming death knights.",
								"Over the years, {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} has kept his eye on the Shadowdusks and their plots, even as he allows the family free rein in their corner of his domain. The Mad Mage has decided that these are the kinds of nobles that need to be making decisions and wielding power in Waterdeep\u2014so that he can secretly rule the city using them as puppets. As such, he encourages the Shadowdusks to consolidate power in preparation for a triumphant and bloody return to Waterdeep, after which Halaster will seize power as the city's Shadow Lord.",
								"The Shadowdusk family motto used to be \"No secrets without truth.\" After the family's fall, its motto changed to \"We do not fear the darkness.\" The family's crest is a lit torch with three embers rising from the flame, set against a purple background. In the wake of the family's descent into Undermountain and madness, this crest has been literally turned upside down, so that the torch flame points downward.",
