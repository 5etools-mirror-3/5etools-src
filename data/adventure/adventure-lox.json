With or without Xedalli's help, the characters must assemble an unlikely alliance to strike at the heart of the astral elf empire.",

								"After the elves select a suitable host world, ships known as star moths release hundreds of astral seeds into the planet's atmosphere. The seeds fall from the sky and bury themselves in the ground and the oceans of the world. After the astral seeds take root, they produce enormous crystalline vines. The tendrils of these vines extend deep into the world and draw life energy from it. Once the vines have sapped a world of its energy, a process that can take months, they send out a bright beam of light that travels back to Xaryxis, temporarily replenishing the star's radiance and leaving the host world a barren husk.",

Destroying the star Xaryxis, which acts as a lodestone for the astral seeds, is the only way to free a world from their grip. If the star goes dark, the crystal vines release their stored energy back into the host world, shrivel, and die."

The mind flayers were attacked and wiped out by githyanki, who disabled the nautiloid and left it adrift. Human pirates found the wreck and tried to plunder it, unaware that the psurlons left behind a hidden clutch of eggs. After hatching from their eggs, the juvenile psurlons began preying on the pirates, killing several of them and forcing the rest to flee. One of the psurlons then assumed the form of a pirate named Benoto Kralazar and has since been using the disguise to lure other victims onto the {@i Lucent Edict}.",

The tale is not entirely fanciful\u2014a band of neogi did recently board the {@i Lucent Edict} in search of salvage, but they retreated once they realized the nautiloid was home to a bunch of psurlons."
