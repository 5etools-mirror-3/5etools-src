						"The Temple of Moloch was said to have begun as a series of caverns where the elemental princes Olhydra and Ogrémoch once battled, and in so doing, opened a rift to their respective Elemental Planes. This rift between the Plane of Water and the Plane of Earth resulted in a stream flowing through the caverns, which carries with it gemstones of extreme size and quality\u2014particularly rubies. When ancient peoples came upon these gems, their greed led them to gather as many as possible, and to build a temple at the site to honor Moloch. They built an ornate statue to the exiled archdevil, and set two of the largest ruby gemstones for its eyes.",
						"Centuries later, one of the high priests of the temple, an artificer named {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, was so seduced by power and authority that he slew most of his fellow cultists in a bloody ceremony, then took control of the temple for himself. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} repurposed the chambers of the temple for his own experiments, creating numerous monsters that bore his name (including the thessalhydra), as well as unnatural beasts such as the owlbear that would one day spread across the world.",
						"Several of the missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} made their way to the temple through the years. At the time the characters visit, {@creature Thessalar|IMR} has installed these components in his lab equipment, channeling their magic for the purpose of endless mutation.",
						"Over the years that were the height of {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s power in the temple, the artificer's chief rival was the artificer {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, architect of the Tomb of Horrors. {@creature Moghadam|IMR} recently lured away several sculptors from {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s temple to help construct his tomb, with false promises of vast salaries. To add insult to injury, {@creature Moghadam|IMR} then sent back a party of mercenary thieves and a master gemsmith to steal the temple's most famous gems\u2014the eyes of the great statue of Moloch that is the centerpiece of the site. These thieves came under the pretense of delivering animal subjects for {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s experiments, but were captured. The gemsmith {@creature Seodra|IMR} is now forced to labor for {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, while the thieves are the subjects of dark experiments. All are desperate to escape."
