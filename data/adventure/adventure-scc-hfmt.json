Lecture Hall} on {@adventure map 3.1|SCC-CK|0|Map 3.1: the biblioplex} in {@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0}). The course covers the basics of recognizing, deciphering, and understanding the magic behind arcane scripts and symbols. Over the course of the term, students learn how to tell scribbles and doodles from magically imbued symbols, and they study popular accounts of adventurers who've come across magic-based writing in their travels. They also learn about common spells that incorporate writing and symbology in their casting. The course's professor is Brenneth Blackstone (chaotic good dhampir {@creature Silverquill professor of shadow|SCC}; see {@book chapter 7|SCC|8|Silverquill Professor of Shadow}), a rising star in scriptology whose dynamic lectures are practically performance art.",
						"This course's first Exam takes place a short while after the events of the \"{@adventure Mascots Everywhere!|SCC-HfMT|0|Mascots Everywhere!}\" section and tests students on their knowledge of scrivening and symbology, as expressed in {@spell glyph of warding} spells.

Director Quenthorne wrote about a student who practiced bizarre magic while attending Strixhaven during Quenthorne's tenure as an administrator 200 years ago. This student used magic to siphon energy and life from creatures. The tome describes the strange magic's lingering aura, which is identical to the magic the characters have observed. This student was censured repeatedly for breaking the university's bylaws and was expelled. The tome states that the student left and never returned to campus. The name of the student is blacked out or illegible in all mentions. Attempts at restoring the name (magical or otherwise) are ineffective."
