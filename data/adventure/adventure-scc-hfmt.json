Lecture Hall} on {@adventure map 3.1|SCC-CK|0|Map 3.1: the biblioplex} in {@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0}). The course covers the basics of recognizing, deciphering, and understanding the magic behind arcane scripts and symbols. Over the course of the term, students learn how to tell scribbles and doodles from magically imbued symbols, and they study popular accounts of adventurers who've come across magic-based writing in their travels. They also learn about common spells that incorporate writing and symbology in their casting. The course's professor is Brenneth Blackstone (chaotic good dhampir {@creature Silverquill professor of shadow|SCC}; see {@book chapter 7|SCC|8|Silverquill Professor of Shadow}), a rising star in scriptology whose dynamic lectures are practically performance art.",
						"This course's first Exam takes place a short while after the events of the \"{@adventure Mascots Everywhere!|SCC-HfMT|0|Mascots Everywhere!}\" section and tests students on their knowledge of scrivening and symbology, as expressed in {@spell glyph of warding} spells. For more information about the rules used for Exams, see {@book chapter 3|SCC|3|Exams}.",
