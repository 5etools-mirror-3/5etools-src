However, the true monsters of this land are found in the degenerating cities of old, where humanity clings to survival. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. The only hope in Etharis is that which you bring, yourself.",

The rules added in the Grim Hollow tomes are designed for weaving dark fantasy tales. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey bargains, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight."

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters.

A small tribe of nine faevlin are spread out across the Bone House. One is assisting the bone trader with its work. Two are moving supplies into the ruined cabin. Two more are searching the refuse pit for trinkets and gold.

The only light sources at night are the cooking fire in the faevlin camp and the braziers (kept burning constantly) in the bone manse. Otherwise, the forest and cavern are dark. Characters observing the scene see the faevlin eventually swap places or jobs, but other than the day-night crew change, the faevlin always divide into work crews.",

Captured characters unwilling or unable to make a deal may find themselves fed on, one at a time, over the next few days. Escape is always possible, of course!",

Eventually one of the baron's many enemies did him in, and Faren's Rest became independent once again.",

Of course, payment in Shadowsteel or sufficient gold was also acceptable, allowing the rich to buy their curses as the poor pledged their service.",

						"Now, as the city's future is uncertain, a young and ambitious necromancer has rediscovered the Sardonyx Necropolis, so named for the rare and precious red and white marble and gemstones decorating the central mausoleum. In his quest to enhance his city's power, the necromancer began animating the dead, whose corpses have lain undisturbed for so long. Unfortunately for him, his power was insufficient to control them, and now the city above is attacked each night by bands of roving undead soldiers wearing, horrifically enough, the tattered remnants of the city's own uniforms from its glory days.",

The city's leadership has been reminded of the Sardonyx Necropolis's existence, but the city's watch has its hands full guarding the sewers, caves, and basements where the undead have broken through to the surface. Adventurers are needed to descend to the necropolis, destroy the undead, and stop whoever is causing the problem.",
								"Alternatively, the necropolis may still be sealed, but important people (perhaps including the characters) are receiving horrifying visions of the dead rising from their graves and destroying the city. The visions all end with an image of a red-and-white stone structure embossed with sardonyx stones. Research in the city library reveals the existence of the necropolis, and the characters must go there to confront the source of the visions before the worst comes to pass. If your adventures have taken your characters far from any city, feel free instead to put this necropolis above the first level of a dungeon or just below a ruined wilderness temple."

Clever characters may use this strategy to draw undead where they want them, but since the dead are drawn to the light, they may get more than they bargain for! Descriptions assume the characters have some way to see but not necessarily in color.",

If using the city-under-siege model, the characters should not have time to descend at night but should be strongly encouraged to enter during the day.

The kobolds piled small offerings around the mated pair in hopes that when they awoke, the draconic creatures grant blessings and favor to the tribe. A few weeks ago, two-thirds of the tribe was eaten the first day the pair woke, but that didn't stop the kobolds. The tribe brought more offerings, capturing wild game, farmers, and livestock to appease the lindwyrm pair which, with their hunger sated, began to tolerate the kobolds. Other than a few raids of their own against nearby villages or farms, the lindwyrms have turned their attention toward their hatching eggs. Shortly after they hatch, the lindwyrms will outpace the ability of the kobolds to feed them, and the rest of the surrounding villages will be endangered. Should an entire brood of lindwyrms spawn, the entire north will be imperiled.",

The Tolfersons were popular and the eldest son, Ulfrick Snow-Swimmer, was a local hero for saving two children from drowning when they feel through the ice. The adventurers are begged to follow the tracks, rescue the family, and wreck a terrible vengeance upon those who would raid the clan.

Within a month, Krumm and his followers had created a well for water, a garden for food, abundant game for meat, and Krumm knew privacy like they never had before.",
