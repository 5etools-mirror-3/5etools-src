						"The Snout of Omgar was once a peninsula, but upheaval wrought by the Spellplague broke off the tip of the peninsula, creating an island separated from mainland Chult by a narrow strait. When the separation occurred, tortles living in the vicinity claimed the island as their domain. The strait provided a natural defense against aggressive mainland predators.",
						"The tortles of the Snout are hospitable folk who like to hunt, catch fish, build things, and trade with visitors. Not long after the island was formed, a pirate ship captained by a cleric of the sea goddess {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} was caught in a typhoon and swept ashore. Tortles rescued the shipwrecked survivors and looked after them. The captain impressed the tortles with her magic and told stories that painted {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} in a flattering light. In time, she persuaded them to raise a palace in her deity's honor. The cleric chose a mountainside overlooking the sea, and there the tortles spent a decade building {@adventure Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}, which secretly served as a temple of {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG}. In return, the cleric and her followers left the tortles alone and were quiet neighbors.",
						"Over time, the island's {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} worshipers died off, and the palace fell into ruin. Descendants of the tortles who built the {@adventure Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)} soon discovered evil creatures lurking within. Older tortles wisely shun the ruined palace, but younger tortles occasionally try to explore it as a rite of passage. Few of them get far before strange monsters frighten them away."

						"Nested at the foot of a mountain is an ancient yuan-ti shrine dedicated to Merrshaulk. {@creature Yuan-ti Abomination|MM|Yuan-ti Abominations} once offered sacrifices here, hoping to wake their slumbering deity or gain flickers of divine insight.",
						"Near the base of the mountain is a giant carving of a snake's head, its forked tongue forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-high stone ramp. Stone fangs descend from the roof of the serpent's mouth, which forms a canopy over a dark, ten-foot-wide tunnel leading into the mountain.",
						"The tunnel at the back of the serpent's head is 200 feet long and corkscrews gently down into the mountain, ending before an unlit oval chamber. Characters who have a light source or can see in the dark can discern the room's features:",
						"The tunnel ends at a domed oval room thirty feet deep, twenty feet wide, and twenty feet high. The walls are carved with frescoes depicting swarms of snakes. At the far end of the room is a cracked, bowl-shaped altar, three feet tall and six feet in diameter, caked with dried blood. Set into the base of the bowl is an empty niche, and hanging from the ceiling above the altar is a bloodstained iron hook at the end of a rusty chain.",
						"A search of the wall frescoes reveals that the snakes' eye sockets once held precious gemstones. Xorn living in the mountain plucked out and ate all the gems, leaving behind empty, faceted indentations.",
						"Yuan-ti liked to impale their sacrifices on the hook above the altar. The victims' blood would pool in the altar's stone bowl, and the {@filter yuan-ti|bestiary|tag=yuan-ti} would wash themselves in the blood while calling Merrshaulk's name, hoping to rouse the god from his slumber.",

The snakes claim to have useful information to share if the characters are willing to complete a quest for them.",

Ssura and Y'zleth want it found and returned to the niche in the base of the altar. The thief and its kind live in caves that riddle the mountains (see \"{@area Geonid Caves,|056|x}\").
