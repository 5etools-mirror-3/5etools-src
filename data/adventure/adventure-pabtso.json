				"More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge called the Forge of Spells, where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby town of Phandalin prospered as well. But disaster struck when bandits swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.",

Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and knowledge of the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.",

Hundreds of years ago, old Phandalin was a thriving town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver Pact. However, the same bandits who sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave attacked the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.",
				"In the last three or four years, hardy folk from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun settling atop the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier town has developed on the site of the old settlement. It's home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few ruffians and bandits have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has been hounding Phandalin, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk only as \"Glasstaff.\"",

												"The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine\u2014loud enough to make the stone underfoot vibrate. The waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.",
												"Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near an ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine connects to an underground hot spring. The spring boils over continuously, producing a surge that slams into a narrow funnel and sounds like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion; it should pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source\u2014and consequently draw them deeper into the mine."

The mind flayers demand that Ruxithid's goblins find peculiar, black stone shards that came from an ancient obelisk once erected in the wilds outside of Phandalin. The obelisk originated in the ancient Netherese empire and is said to have transformative capabilities, although the goblins know very little about its properties or history. The goblins know only that their \"gods\" traced some of the obelisk's shards to Phandalin, covet the shards for some greater purpose, and demand the Sawplees' help.",

These goblins have inhabited the outpost for generations, with some of their number displaying psionic abilities that trace to the aberrant influence of the mind flayers who also once lived there. Only recently have the goblins ventured beyond the outpost and ransacked nearby areas.",

The duergar had a lucrative business making collapsible cages (their well-crafted hanging cages gave the crossroads its name), and the duergar came to rely on mithral that the svirfneblin supplied. The drow provided the duergar with security in exchange for inclusion in svirfneblin trade contracts, while the drow simultaneously negotiated fair prices for duergar goods. Tensions between the three groups were always present. When mind flayers attacked the area long ago, the groups didn't fight alongside one another and were individually annihilated.",

								"Many slaadi reproduce by implanting Humanoid hosts with eggs that transform into slaad tadpoles. In the weird dimension of the Far Realm, however, biology takes strange turns. Slaad explorers recently discovered a place where tadpoles can grow on their own, albeit slowly. The quasi-organic chambers of this region emerge from a whirlpool and disappear into a nearby vortex. This motion is inexorable but takes several weeks; it was a while before the slaadi even noticed it. Although the walls, floor, and ceilings look like tough skin, they are as dense as stone and rot quickly if sliced off.",
								"The slaadi call this mysterious area Spawn Hollow and guard it fiercely. They know about the rift and worry that the mind flayers of Illithinoch might try to expel them. They don't realize that the mind flayer fanatics placed their bolstering rune before the slaadi arrived and don't care about returning.",
								"The characters can access Spawn Hollow from {@area area X5|364|x} in Illithinoch. The following locations are keyed to map 7.4.",

Ghaluzesh is invulnerable while swimming in the waters of the Shallows of Sudden Thought, but once the characters drain the Shallows, they can take the fight to the kraken.
