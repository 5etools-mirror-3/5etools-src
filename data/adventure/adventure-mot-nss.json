If there is not already a creature inside the amphora, the target is {@condition restrained} inside. As an action, the {@condition restrained} creature can make a DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check, escaping from the amphora on a success. The effect also ends if the amphora is destroyed. The amphora has AC 8, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.",
												"In addition to taking action against those who don't fit inside his amphora, Antigonos attacks any characters who insult him or try to rob him. Despite his age, he can still muster a flash of his past prowess. He gets distracted easily, though, using his greataxe and amphora (if it is empty) on random targets. If the party attacks him for attempting to harm a character, he curses them for trying to impede the will of the gods and retaliates.",
												"If the party doesn't attack the minotaur, he calms down after a few rounds. The minotaur is clearly a victim of Mogis's cruelty. Any character who proposes Antigonos follow their deity instead of remaining in Mogis's shadow, or suggests a similar course, can make a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If they succeed, Antigonos abandons his amphora, then goes off to learn more about his potential new god. Even if the character fails this check, the minotaur turns thoughtful and departs.",

Any character who succeeds at a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check learns that the sarcophagus itself bears a measure of Orestes's oracular gifts. If blood is spilled on the lid, it turns black if the blood's owner is destined to become a Returned. Most of the time, spilled blood doesn't change color. If a character drips their blood upon the sarcophagus lid, though, you can decide if their blood turns black or not\u2014choosing if you want the character's story to go in that direction (and you think the character's player will accept it), or rolling a {@dice d10} and having it turn black on a 1. The ramifications of this revelation are up to you."

						"Characters curious about the nature of Phenax's Silence find no grand prize in the Court of Orestes. Rather than great wealth, the seer Orestes vaguely predicted the events that would transpire here. As a result, his prophecy and the resulting legend of Phenax's Silence foreshadowed the memories the god lost when returning from the Underworld and the first step to giving those memories voice once more: Varyas's eidolon.",

While Varyas's eidolon doesn't remember the message's contents, it retains the ability to interpret the cipher\u2014though, possibly in piecemeal or half-accurate terms. Deciphering the mask is an elaborate process, and keeping the eidolon on task is a time-consuming endeavor, requiring that a character spend an hour and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check. On a failed check, the eidolon rambles, sharing disjointed half-memories and dreamy opinions about its surroundings. On a success, the eidolon reveals a snippet of the cipher's meaning.",
