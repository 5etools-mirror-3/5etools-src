The Underdark is filled with races and creatures too numerous to count or list, and foremost among these are the dark elves\u2014the drow. Hated and feared even by their fellow dwellers in darkness, the drow raid other settlements in the Underdark as well as the surface world, taking prisoners back with them. Rendered {@condition unconscious} with drow poison, then collared and shackled, these prisoners are eventually sold as slaves or entertainment in the dark elves' subterranean cities.",
				"The adventurers have all had the misfortune of falling to such a fate. Captured by the drow, they are prisoners at one of the dark elves' outposts, awaiting transportation to Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Whether they came into the Underdark seeking knowledge or fortune, or were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, they were ripe prey for a drow raid.",
				"The setup of {@i Out of the Abyss} is such that the characters need have no connections with events in the Underdark, or with each other, prior to the start of the adventure. They can meet and get to know each other as prisoners of the drow. Players who would like their characters to have a stronger Underdark connection can choose from the background options in {@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}.",

Given the challenges of the adventure and the dangers of the Underdark, you can start the characters at a higher level (2nd or 3rd) to make things a bit easier for the players.",

The iron collars can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The collars have 12 hit points.

It screeches at the characters, but if they do nothing to threaten it for 1 round, the demon takes wing and launches itself back into the fight overhead.",

Gracklstugh toils endlessly, its smiths churning out the best armor and weapons among the Underdark races. Those who do business here refer to Gracklstugh as \"the City of Blades.\"",

For the characters, this means a potential chance to find a way back to the surface world\u2014and just as importantly, to shake off the drow that pursue them. However, the adventurers will quickly realize that the power of the demon lords is a threat even here, getting an even closer glimpse of the Underdark's decay as the madness of the Abyss continues to spread.",
				"Built within the walls of a deep cavern southwest of the Darklake, Gracklstugh is the commercial, political, and spiritual center of the duergar, all of whom look to the Deepking with respect. The city has an open shore along the Darklake, while several caverns and passages connect Gracklstugh to other parts of the Underdark to facilitate travel and trade.",
				"The characters have a chance to witness and shape events in the city that point toward the danger Gracklstugh faces\u2014and how unprepared the city is for it.

They know that duergar have no love for the drow, and their draconian laws keep all foreigners in check, which should provide some measure of sanctuary from drow pursuit. Gracklstugh is as good a place as any in the Underdark to sell stolen gear and buy more useful equipment. Additionally, the duergar trade actively with other subterranean and surface-dwelling races. Gracklstugh's Blade Bazaar might be the ideal place to find traders or explorers heading to the surface world.",

Sarith resists plans to travel to the city at first, conscious of the low regard the duergar have for drow.

								"A transformed myconid can release the spores in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a Constitution saving throw. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution modifier + the myconid's proficiency bonus. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry in the {@i Monster Manual})."

Fortunately for them, Zuggtmoy is deep in meditation as her gown and veil are being prepared. She doesn't move, although she can speak and use her other abilities. Her bridesmaids attempt to chase off intruders, wailing and scolding them about how it is unlucky for them to see the bride before it is time. If the characters don't withdraw immediately, Zuggtmoy awakens and uses her Mind Control Spores ability to send them away, using her Infestation Spores only if the characters insist on engaging the demon lord here and now.",
										"Dozens of spore servants and myconids respond to Zuggtmoy's telepathic call if their mistress is in danger, attacking the characters heedless of their own safety. Any attack that successfully deals damage to Zuggtmoy damages her gown, driving the demon queen into a rage to attack the intruders."

				"For centuries, Blingdenstone remained hidden and isolated from the rest of the Underdark, thanks to a combination of misdirection and magic. It wasn't until they provided shelter to a drow exile named Drizzt Do'Urden that the deep gnomes began to take a more active interest in the world outside their caverns. Perceiving the threat the drow represented to all the peoples of the Underdark, the deep gnomes abandoned their isolation when they came to the defense of the dwarves of Mithral Hall, defeating an invading drow force from Menzoberranzan.",
				"This alliance, however, would spell Blingdenstone's doom. The vengeful drow bided their time, rebuilt their forces, and sent their armies out to strike back hard against the svirfneblin, returning in great force to lay siege to Blingdenstone. The deep gnomes were no match for the drow army. Thousands of svirfneblin were slaughtered, and those survivors who didn't escape to Mithral Hall or the surface world were dragged back in chains to Menzoberranzan as slaves.",
				"Within the past decade or so, the deep gnomes have returned to reclaim, resettle, and rebuild their city. The ultimate success of their efforts, however, hangs by a slender thread. Most of the ruined city is a dangerous place and remains closed off, with tunnels and chambers barricaded with gates or deliberately caused cave-ins. The svirfneblin must contend with incursions by wererat squatters, insane elementals, ghosts, and a plague of invading oozes controlled by {@creature the Pudding King|OotA}\u2014a mad deep gnome under the influence of the demon lord Juiblex.

Its cavernous halls\u2014some large enough to contain entire surface villages\u2014were carved with unerring precision, their ceilings soaring scores of feet overhead. Towering statues of dwarven gods and heroes stood vigil over chambers and thoroughfares, the least of which was wide enough to march fifty dwarves standing abreast.",
						"The mines of Gauntlgrym produced endless tides of iron, silver, gold, and mithral, and booming trade brought goods and wealth to the city from across Faerûn. But it was the Great Forge that was the burning heart and true treasure of the city. Deep beneath the settled levels of Gauntlgrym, dwarven crafting and elven magic bound the slumbering primordial Maegera, a being of fire and destruction, harnessing its incredible powers to heat the forge. On anvils of adamantine blessed by priests of Moradin, great items of power were forged, their base material infused with a splinter of Maegera's essence. The unceasing wonders flowing from these forges helped make Gauntlgrym into one of the most magnificent cities Faerûn has ever known.",
						"Relations between the great empires of the elves, dwarves, and humans soured as the centuries passed. And so when numberless hordes of orcs smashed into the north, each empire stood alone. The war was brutal and devastating. Gauntlgrym was swarmed by rampaging armies of orcs, and the empire of Delzoun was overrun in the terrible fighting. Ultimately, the dwarves of Delzoun drove back the orcs, but at great cost. The once-mighty dwarven empire was left crippled, never to recover, and the great city of Gauntlgrym was left in the control of an orc horde.",
						"It was humans from nearby Illusk who finally drove the orcs from Gauntlgrym, but their hold on the city proved just as short-lived, as foul creatures from the Underdark swarmed from the depths to claim Gauntlgrym as their own. Over the next thousand years, history turned to legend, and mighty Gauntlgrym was all but forgotten on the surface world. Illithids, duergar, drow, and aboleths vied for control of the fallen city, its treasures, and the primordial still bound within its core. The drow House Xorlarrin eventually took Gauntlgrym, establishing a new city they called Q'Xorlarrin, producing weapons at the forge that they traded and used to pay tribute to Menzoberranzan.",
						"In recent years, the dwarf hero Bruenor Battlehammer was able to seize the fabled city back from its drow masters. Bruenor, along with his companions Wulfgar, Cattie-brie, Regis, and Drizzt Do'Urden, gathered many allies from the surface world and nearby Underdark communities and retook the city. They prevented Maegera from being unleashed upon Faerûn, and set about attempting to restore the city to its former glory. Bruenor now sits upon the Great Throne of Moradin, working to rebuild the city and keep it safe\u2014even as a new threat looms in the depths of the Underdark.",

Despite its usefulness and the safety it enjoys, Mantol-Derith has never become a proper town. Those who maintain it as a trade hub have resisted any urge for expansion, apart from installing basic infrastructure to assist with commercial activities.",
				"The Zhentarim took over the holdings where surface dwellers conducted business and quickly cornered the market for surface goods, gaining the organization a foothold in the Underdark. This presence grew into a power base that serves the Black Network well, and which is now being made available to the characters.",
				"Upon arrival, however, the characters discover there is no safe haven anywhere in the Underdark with the demon lords running rampant. The safety of Mantol-Derith has been shattered by the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu, who has turned the trading outpost's various factions against one another.",
				"The characters must navigate and overcome the madness dominating Mantol-Derith in order to find their Zhentarim contact, {@creature Ghazrim DuLoc|OotA}.

						"Having previously been imprisoned for many mortal lifetimes on the Material Plane, Fraz-Urb'luu had taken steps to bind himself to his layer of the Abyss. As soon as he felt the tug of Gromph's spell, Fraz-Urb'luu transferred his evil life force to a specially crafted, magically protected receptacle\u2014a black jewel. However, the spell proved irresistible, and the precious receptacle was cast into the Underdark. As a further indignity, Fraz-Urb'luu found himself trapped within the gem, unable to escape while on the Material Plane.",
						"Anyone who touches the gem risks falling prey to delusional madness. A duergar ale merchant named Krimgol Muzgardt found the gem and took it to Mantol-Derith. By the time he arrived, Krimgol had succumbed to the delusion that he was a {@i calassabrak}\u2014a duergar without honor. He paid Yantha Coaxrock, an honest svirfneblin mage, to appraise the jewel, hoping that he could use it to buy back the goodwill of his clan. Touched by the gem's madness, Yantha lied to Krimgol and told him the gem was worthless. She offered a lump of gold in exchange, whereupon Krimgol suspected treachery and demanded the gem's immediate return. While Krimgol and Yantha argued, one of Yantha's apprentices tried to hide the gem for his mistress but succumbed to its evil power. The apprentice, Flink, took the gem to the drow enclave, hoping to trade it for some rare spell components that he imagined Yantha needing to make Krimgol go away. A gargoyle assigned to watch for thieves spotted the gem and wrested it from Flink, who hid for fear of incurring Yantha's wrath. Soon thereafter, the delusional gargoyle laid eyes on a drow assassin named {@creature Kinyel Druu'giir|OotA} and was instantly smitten by her. The gargoyle gave her the black gem as a token of its devotion, which she, in her madness, mistook as a payment from the drow enclave to assassinate {@creature Lorthuun|OotA}, a maimed beholder allied with the Zhentarim.",
						"Yantha's theft of the gem led Krimgol to leave and return with duergar reinforcements. They attacked the svirfneblin enclave and captured Yantha, triggering open conflict between the two enclaves. With the fragile truce in Mantol-Derith finally broken, the drow are preparing to take out the weakened duergar and svirfneblin forces. Meanwhile, Druu'giir has infiltrated a drow delegation sent to meet with representatives of the Zhentarim enclave to discuss how best to divvy up Mantol-Derith between them.",
						"Finding and destroying the gem prevents others from falling prey to Fraz-Urb'luu's madness. While imprisoned inside the gem, {@creature Fraz-Urb'luu|MTF} retains his alignment and senses (see {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}), but loses all of his other attributes and can't take actions. The gem is as big as a human fist and has AC 10, 1 hit point, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. It is also immune to any spell effect that requires a saving throw. While inside the gem, the demon lord can't be attacked, harmed, coerced, or heard. He can be contacted via telepathy, however. Shattering the gem releases Fraz-Urb'luu's life force, which instantly returns to the demon lord's body in the Abyss.",
						"Any creature that touches the gem must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or succumb to a form of indefinite madness, as determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table in {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the madness-inducing effect of the gem for the next 24 hours. The madness lasts until cured.",

The Black Network doesn't reveal the shortest route for security reasons. Instead, its representatives lead the adventurers to a remote cave in the Surbrin Hills, about 180 miles east of Gauntlgrym. Black Network sentries (six human {@creature Veteran||veterans}) guard the cave, which leads to a series of tunnels. These tunnels descend sharply as they wind their way east for another 200 miles.

Characters accompanied by Zhentarim guides approach Mantol-Derith via a subterranean rift.

Normally, life in Mantol-Derith is regulated by three simple covenants: no stealing of goods from fellow merchants, no disguising of goods by any means, and no use of magic during negotiations and haggling. The punishment for breaking any covenant is equally straightforward: the violator is wrapped in chains and tossed into the Darklake. Recent events in Mantol-Derith have rendered these rules moot.",

The diffuse light the mushrooms shed makes the vista waver as if seen through mist.",
								"\"Araumycos,\" a voice says in your mind. You turn and see a myconid sovereign standing beside you where there was no one before, recognizing Basidia of Neverlight Grove. \"The largest and greatest being of our world,\" the myconid says sadly. \"All that you see before you is Araumycos; all this and much more. All is in danger from the corruption that will claim the whole of the world if you do not help us.\""

						"Although myconids can normally use their rapport spores only over short distances, Basidia explains that Zuggtmoy has been spreading her own spores throughout the Underdark, channeling {@i faerzress}. By tapping into this growing presence, the myconid sovereign can rapport over great distances to ask the characters for their help.",
						"Zuggtmoy, the demon queen who has corrupted the myconids, has made her intentions clear. She is leading her new followers to the vast cavern complex occupied by Araumycos, the largest life-form in the Underdark and perhaps in all the world. There, the two will be bonded in a demonic ceremony, giving Zuggtmoy dominion over a fungal kingdom larger and greater than any surface-world realm. To that end, she and her followers have been performing rituals and releasing spores to lull the great Araumycos into a kind of {@condition charmed} sleep. The full implications are unclear to Basidia and the myconids, but as Araumycos is the oldest and most powerful being known to them, they greatly fear what Zuggtmoy's corruption of it will bring.",
						"Fortunately, there is hope. Basidia believes it can assist in creating a rapport between the adventurers and Araumycos's vast, sleeping mind. The characters can help to awaken it and aid its struggle against the demon queen's influence. Or, if there's no other choice, they can destroy Araumycos before Zuggtmoy can claim the great creature as her own.",
						"If {@creature Stool|OotA} or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} have met the characters and are still alive, they join the rapport between Basidia and the characters, offering their support and encouragement as they implore the adventurers to intervene. If the characters saw the hideous Garden of Welcome in Neverlight Grove\u2014or, worse yet, glimpsed the horrors of Yggmorgus\u2014the myconids remind them that the whole world might become like that if Zuggtmoy unites Araumycos's power with her own.",
						"Basidia proposes that the characters travel quickly to Araumycos, where the myconid sovereign will temporarily immunize them against the effects of the demon-tainted spores released by myconids under Zuggtmoy's influence. Basidia will then initiate a rapport with Araumycos while Zuggtmoy and her followers are preoccupied with the wedding ceremony.",
						"Basidia and its followers can meet the adventurers within Araumycos's vast cavern complex. The sovereign is too closely watched to slip away and meet them before that, and it recommends that the characters avoid contact with other myconids on their travels. Basidia can use the extended rapport link to fix on the characters' location, and promises to find them when they are near the center of Araumycos. The vision then ends."

						"In the Rage of Demons story, demon lords invade the Underdark and spread madness throughout the subterranean realm. (As if the Underdark wasn't dangerous enough already!) The Underdark is home to some of the D&D game's most iconic monsters, as well as cultures both alien and wondrous.",
						"To bring the Underdark to life, Richard Whitters and his concept artists created amazing imagery tied to various Underdark races: kuo-toa waymarkers, illithid \"brain urns\" and domiciles, duergar architecture, drow costuming, and much, much more. Their concept art was featured a \"story bible\" that we gave to our licensed partners. That story bible served as inspiration for miniatures, digital projects, and print products like the adventure you hold in your hands.",
						"This appendix contains a sampling of the concept art we commissioned for the Rage of Demons story. We hope that this art further inspires you to run Out of the Abyss or create your own Underdark encounters.",
