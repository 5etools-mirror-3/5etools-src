						"{@creature Krenko|KKW} is the boss of a notorious goblin mob, and he has made his fortune and built his reputation by mostly staying out of the guilds' way. He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District, but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, {@creature Krenko|KKW} has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that {@creature Krenko|KKW} killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.",

Before they could do the deed, {@creature Krenko|KKW} was apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into Sawtooth Prison\u2014near the legion's headquarters of Sunhome\u2014to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But someone as well connected as {@creature Krenko|KKW} has ways of shortening his own sentence.",
						"Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate. During the transfer, agents of a former associate of {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.",
						"{@creature Krenko|KKW}'s escape is no small matter. The Chamber of the Guildpact gets involved, alarmed at the possibility of another goblin gang war that could threaten the tenuous peace between the guilds.
