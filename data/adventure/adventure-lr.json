As elemental forces threaten the safety of the nearby locathah communities, heroes rise from among their number to strike back and defend their homes and families. {@i Locathah Rising} is a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for 9th-level characters. You can run this adventure for as few as three or as many as six players.

He was embittered by a life of suffering at the hands of others: pirates killed his family when he was young, he was forced into servitude aboard a merchant ship, and then another band of pirates left him to die on the open sea, where he lost his arm to a shark. Gar saw the elemental power of water as the only thing of value in his life and gathered others who felt similarly.",
								"Gar wielded the elemental weapon Drown, a magical trident of great power, and his missing arm was replaced by an artificial limb in the shape of a crab's claw. As the leader of Olhydra's cult, he could channel her innate magic, which inspired awe and fear in the other Crushing Wave cultists.",
								"Fortunately for the denizens of the Sword Coast, heroes discovered the collective plots of the elemental prophets and put an end to their machinations, defeating each of them in turn, and sending each prophet back to the evil elemental being they revered and served.",
								"On the Elemental Plane of Water, Gar raged in protest. Drown had been broken, and the Crushing Wave cult sundered. He faced Olhydra's displeasure, expecting to be destroyed by her wrath, and was astonished to awaken several years later, floating off the coast of Turmish in the Sea of Fallen Stars. He gripped a trident in one hand, though it was not Drown.",
								"Gar discovered that the ancient weapon had been gifted to him by the sea goddess Umberlee who, in conjunction with Olhydra, managed to reinstate the prophet with power even more formidable than he previously enjoyed. The seas and the storms that raged above now heeded his commands, and\u2014free of the original compact made with the other prophets\u2014Gar could seek success unburdened by any past commitments.",
								"Gazing upon the trident, Gar looked for signs of the power that he felt surging within and was shocked when the trident spoke to him, \"I am WAVE, and we are ONE!\"",
								"With Wave in his possession, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} discovered and unlocked a node of elemental power deep beneath the waves, directly under the shipping lanes of those who transport themselves and other valuables across the Sea of Fallen Stars. There he opened a rift, drew on its power, and created a place where ships would be destroyed and dragged beneath the waves.",
								"As ship after ship has been destroyed by wind and wave, they have come to rest in close proximity to where Gar has encouraged the preternatural growth of the coral and other such sea life to create his new lair. From his aquatic home, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} foments his plans to seek out and destroy all who dare to cross these waters without paying the proper tribute to Umberlee and Olhydra.",

Instead, their ships choose to chart a course around the area, avoiding it altogether for the time being.",

Coming from a quiet race of fish-folk, the locathah are indeed alarmed at the violent turn the waves have taken so near their home.
