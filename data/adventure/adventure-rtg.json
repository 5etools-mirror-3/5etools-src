				"This adventure is designed for four to six ORC characters, levels 6 to 8, and is optimized for five characters with an average party level (APL) of 6. Characters outside this level range shouldn't participate in this adventure without heavy modification to the difficulty of the encounters. This adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms near Turmish, in the western Orsraun Mountains just north of the Flooded Forest. To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. Stat Blocks. The Monster Manual contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and nonplayer characters (NPCs) found in this adventure. Whenever this adventure presents a new monster or NPC, you'll find its stat block near the encounter in which it appears, or in appendix A. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual.",

												"As you're preparing to play this adventure, you'll want to ask each of the players about their characters hopes and dreams for this expedition. This is also a good time to ask players about lines and veils as well. It's important to avoid personal triggers in an encounter like this. If they're uncomfortable speaking of these things in front of the group, provide them with a note card or other private means to communicate these with you. This should occur before they even begin wandering around the dungeon, and it can happen as part of a 'sending-off' ritual held by the elders that set them on this task.",
												"Once the characters enter, it will be up to you to improvise the description of the areas as the balhannoth hunts them down and attempts to pick them off, one-by-one. If that weren't enough, there is a trio of gelatinous cubes wandering these halls, taking advantage of the confusion caused by the balhannoth to feed."
