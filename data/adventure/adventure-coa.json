				"This story takes place in the Nine Hells and sees the characters confront its ruler, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. They venture into the Nine Hells to save the souls of their loved ones (or their own) and are aided by a powerful faction. This faction has its own reasons for wanting revenge on {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. With the help of the characters, the faction believes it can deal a devastating blow to him. In return for a favor, the faction provides characters with access to the Nine Hells and a means of traversing the different layers. The characters travel by barge down the River Styx, also known as the River of Blood, a cross-planar river that links the layers of the Nine Hells. Those who touch or drink from its waters risk forgetting their past lives permanently.",
				"The characters try to avoid {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s attention, believing themselves unwanted infiltrators who are there to undermine the Lord of the Nine Hells. Little do they know, they're here by his design. They're integral to one of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s plots, and he aims to recruit them. But to get them under his control, he needs to corrupt them. It took years of careful planning, and now, finally, he has the characters exactly where he wants them. They will be tested, with temptations and traps set which only the pure of heart can resist. Each time a character gives in to sin, a link is added to the chains that bind them to the Nine Hells, to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. Can they save their loved ones without losing themselves in the process?",

Moving through the ranks requires either manipulating the strict laws of the realm, betraying comrades, or commanders\u2014or sometimes both. Devils that find themselves higher in the hierarchy tend to lead relatively comfortable lives, so long as they obey their superiors and maintain a steady stream of souls. For the battle-hungry, the Blood War always longs for more combatants, and proving oneself on the battlefield is a surefire way to a quick promotion. As for the various non-devil inhabitants, existence remains possible so long as it doesn't interfere with devilish schemes. For mortals? Just try not to die."

Jangling Hiter, the home of the chain devils, also lies in this realm, suspended on chains attached to the bottom of Dis.",

Closing the massive distance between the ceiling of the cave and the bog below, the river turns into cascading waterfalls and severe rapids, eventually falling almost 200 feet into a small pool in the swamp. From here, it winds through the bog to a hot corner of the layer and into an extinct volcano. Inside the caldera is a whirlpool, which dumps into Phlegethos below. For the inexperienced, knowing where the swamp ends and the Styx begins is extremely difficult, and more than a few inhabitants end up walking right into the deadly river, drowning as their memories depart.",

Indeed, it contains vegetation, animal life, and differing pockets of temperature, all features largely unique to Minauros. The entire layer is lit by a bioluminescent fog excreted from the trees, which some devils even describe as beautiful. However, the weather helps temper expectations. Minauros experiences galeforce winds almost constantly, which carry with them the stench of death. Precipitation of some form is constant, with rain and sleet leaving behind an oily slime that covers everything. The occasional hailstorms are extremely dangerous, with pieces of hail falling like thrown daggers.",

Found inside the city is the Diabolical Court, the center of laws within the Nine Hells. Hellfire is also created on this layer, inside the Pit of Flame. Everything in Phlegethos, including the layer itself, is hostile to outsiders, and despite the nature of Abriymoch, travelers often perish here. Only devils and a few other types of creatures can survive this realm's extreme environment. Befitting the inferno of the realm, the River Styx enters through a volcanic portal from Minauros. It mingles with the lava inside the volcano and exits inside its molten rivers. A small layer of obsidian serves as the riverbank, which is also a bank to the lava river flowing alongside the flanks of the Styx. It passes many of the landmarks in the layer, including a dock just outside Abriymoch. As it passes the city, it begins to break from the lava and move deep into the rock, creating a spiraling tunnel system. This spiral leads all the way to Stygia, dropping in temperature the lower it goes.",

Sparse sections of rock make up the floor of the layer, which are blackened and searing to the touch. The air is superheated to the point that it occasionally bursts into balls of fire, and it smells of brimstone as a result. Navigating the realm is usually done via lava barges or flight, with the heated updrafts providing great lift to infernal airships.",

Because no archdevil rules the layer, it has become a haven for devils shirking their duties or looking to escape. Hunting parties supply the inhabitants with food and experience, and travelers along the Styx occasionally bring trade or souls. The inhabitants know that, should {@creature Levistus|CoA} demand their attention, they would have to serve their master. For this reason, even in their lawlessness, they continue to respect his rule. One exception to the dens of Stygia exists: the city of Tantlin. It remains independent from archdevil rule but follows a strict set of rules and regulations.",

										"Of course, there are drawbacks. The ancient and wondrous beasts that once roamed the forests of Maladomini are long extinct, but they're most certainly there to those with eyes to see. And this being the Nine Hells, they're frequently hostile. Many eye-bearers have been killed and devoured by glorious and majestic monsters that their companions can't even see, let alone fight. Moreover, everyone who leaves the Eye Market having conducted business with Vaness and Fling becomes a target. All those waiting outside would give a great deal more than their eyes to get hold of such things, even though the services of Fling would still be required to implant them.

And yet it never quite happens, and somehow the peculiar pair are permitted to run their business, which seems to make a mockery of everything that {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} is constantly, futilely trying to achieve in his domain.",
										"The most persuasive reason is that the eyes, for all their vaunted promise, are a curse. The wearer is at first overwhelmed by the beauty they see, delighted to walk in a 'Hell' that is suddenly restorative and pleasant. Except the truth always creeps in. Those who wear the eyes can stave off reality only so far. In their dreams they see the truth of it, the ruin and the ugliness. Day by day the understanding grows that everything they see, that they could now never live without, is only a sham, however real it is to them. The knowledge torments them, and they're driven to their own hopeless attempts to achieve a lasting perfection. In this way they share in {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s private misery, and perhaps that is enough reason to keep Vaness and Fling around.",

Whilst devils aren't averse to the idea of just leaving things to be tormented forever, they found a use for the giants. So it is that the sharp-eyed visitor scanning the upper reaches of that appalling cliff finds scaffolding and gantries and excavation. Tunnels and quarries that carve into the literal faces of the giants to get at the treasure within.",

A combination of their semidivine nature, the ancient age they were preserved from and their own vast horror at being betrayed means the minds of the giants are a source of the most concentrated misery to be found anywhere in the planes.",

To mortals, the substance is pure vitriol. Concentrated, it causes wounds that strong magic can't heal, and that burn with fresh agony forever. Diluted into a potion it imposes a burden of existential unhappiness that drives the drinkers to empty hedonism and sin as their lives become hollow and meaningless. To devils, the sorrow wine is a potent beverage, a unique vintage of misery fit for the tables of {@creature Mephistopheles|CoA} and {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} themselves. In the Giant Mine, Cania's ruler has a commodity not to be found anywhere else that he uses for bribery, reward, and leverage across the lower planes. His only challenge is reliably extracting it.",

The baron is an ice devil of twice the usual size, emaciated and hunched almost double, usually to be seen squatting on a spider-legged throne formed from an enslaved ice Elemental. Klendisk's public face is that of a monstrous tyrant, cruel in his discipline towards other gelugons and doubly so to any other devil breeds. Behind closed doors, he is a devil with a problem, because mining the giants and producing the sorrow wine is difficult and his own master brooks no excuses. Hence, while a terror to other devils, Klendisk is known to at least give a hearing to outsiders with a solution.",
										"The difficulty is in the very nature of the stuff they mine. The raw seams of misery in the brains of the giants are powerfully destructive. Whilst Klendisk has no compunction about destroying souls or mortal prisoners, the cold of Cania and the corrosive nature of the misery destroys such tools before they can be of much use. Infernal labor has other problems. Contact with the giant-stuff makes them drunk: boisterous and leery with the heady misery of ages. A fiendish workforce would fall to squabbling, brawling and unacceptable indiscipline, even the icy gelugons themselves. It is a pitiful devil that needs to go beg outside help but that is the situation that Klendisk often finds himself in.",
										"Though these mines would seem to be a good place to avoid, mortal travelers do visit. It helps that Cania has few other locales to recommend it, and the town at the foot of the Heights does at least have shelter and goods for trade. Sometimes mortals are sent there by other Fiends, seeking to abstract some of the processed sorrow wine for their own delectation or trade. Klendisk's ice devils keep a compound eye out for strangers, though, and anyone who comes to their attention without a good excuse or permits signed in triplicate find themselves introduced to the mines or the vats in swift order, or else claimed by Klendisk for a little informal torment. Assignment to the Heights is short on entertainment.",

Certainly, individual workers eventually become corrupted by the work, sad little pieces of geometry infected with emotion, grinding to a halt as they're consumed by misery. At which point the Orthoclath casts them out, and the devils are free to devour or toy with them, not that the creatures give any real sport. There are always, apparently, more modrons ready to troop down from the lawful planes and give themselves to the work."

										"{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} seldom deigns to wield the whip himself when someone rouses his ire. He has lesser devils to do that for him. Though, in this case, 'lesser' can still mean very powerful indeed. Adramalech and Morax have served the greatest of Fiends faithfully since the earliest days of the Nine Hells. They were angels within the host {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} commanded. When he fell, they cast themselves willingly down to be with him. In an internal hierarchy rife with ambition and betrayal, the brothers' lawful nature manifests as absolute loyalty. In return, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} gives them what they want. They stand outside the intricate hierarchies of the Nine Hells, reporting directly to him and undertaking his commands with their own hands, his personal enforcers. His 'hounds', say other devils with a sneer of contempt, but Adramalech and Morax are as content with their lot as any devil can be.",
										"They manifest most often as chalky white humanoids, Adramalech around eight feet tall and the hulking Morax, twelve. Morax is the more physically potent of the two, his hide spined and barbed, his hands jagged talons. Adramalech does most of the talking, to dreadful effect. As befits {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s devils-of-all-work, they're a versatile pair of monsters, more than equipped to punish those who have disappointed their master. And 'punish' is the operative term. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} dispatches his enemies to them when they've roused his personal ire.",
										"{@creature Brother Morax|CoA|Morax} (see the accompanying stat block) has the tremendous strength and speed one would expect of a martial devil. His spines are brittle and hollow, and shards of them lodge in the flesh of those he strikes, or who strike him, where they rapidly begin to grow jagged extrusions of their own like miniature sea urchins. The shards must be cut out swiftly before they carve his victims up from the inside. This is mostly by way of a distraction so that {@creature Brother Adramalech|CoA|Adramalech} (see the accompanying stat block) can play his own games though.",
										"Adramalech retains his angelic voice from before the fall. His golden words inveigle their way into the ears of listeners, confusing, distracting, distorting the way they see the world and causing mind-wrenching dissonance in mortal minds. Worse than this, Adramalech can conjure simulacra of his enemies' loved ones, living or dead. More than mere illusions, these creations have a temporary life and thought drawn from the memories of the brothers' enemies. This psychic link means that, when Adramalech torments them or Morax tears them apart, the pain is felt by those whose minds gave rise to them. In this way, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s decreed punishments combine physical agony and mental trauma in equal measure.",
										"Though {@status concentration||concentrating} on destroying the less imposing Adramalech might seem the logical way to assault the brothers, the pair have a final surprise for their foes. They were as close as two angels could get before the fall and nothing in all the eternal ages of the Nine Hells has ever divided them. If either falls while the other still stands, the remaining Brother's presence sets their fallen kin's flesh bubbling in a frenzy of regeneration. They must be defeated together or not at all."

Its greatest joy, however, is to command a battlefield, ordering legions of infernal troops in complex stratagems against the enemies of the Nine Hells. In times past, {@creature Abigor|CoA} has commanded the legions of Maladomini up in Avernus to stem the tides of the Abyss.

Visitors sneaking through Maladomini might be surprised to find legions of devils standing about in parade ground order, or else marching and drilling, every maneuver perfect, yet their general is never satisfied. What the perfect city is to {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}, military exercises are to {@creature Abigor|CoA}. The archdevil forces its troops to march and salute and trudge through ever more complex motions as it plays at war.

On one occasion this resulted in a determined paladin getting far too close to {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} himself, for which {@creature Abigor|CoA} spent some decades being whipped by infernal rust monsters.

In doing so, it can end up missing obvious opportunities to destroy its enemies, or even inadvertently give them an advantage or let them escape.

Near the bottom, the temperature shift causes a small section of the river to melt and finish its journey to Nessus below. This stream is heavily guarded and flows a small distance before pooling into the Forgotten Lake, the last stop. From here, it drains into the porous stone of Nessus, traveling to the very bottom of the layer. It gurgles through a few of the deepest ravines before mysteriously vanishing on its journey to Gehenna.",

Storms of fire and hot wind blow across its surface, and sandstorms aren't uncommon. Though many ravines mar its surface, only a few are important enough to have names. The Serpent's Coil is a massive ravine, rumored to contain {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s true body and caused by his fall into the Nine Hells. Its depth is practically infinite, and no creature has ever gone from the surface of Nessus to the bottom.",

Some scholars believe its pools are fed by the Styx itself, but the river's unique powers and secluded nature make such beliefs impossible to prove. From its spring in Nessus, the Lethe flows across the land, occasionally crossing ravines and canyons, before reaching the edge of the landmass. Unlike the Styx, the Lethe completely defies gravity, flowing over the cracks in the land without breaking its stride. It flows off the edge of Nessus unimpeded, where it continues to run off into the void, seemingly floating into the empty space.",

The ice stretches out for a distance, solid and white with arching crests where swells and rapids have frozen, and then it ends, and all that remains is empty sky. At the edge of the ice one can see out over the barren Nessus plains, vast and sprawling, reaching the far horizon. The drop below is dizzying. The powerful waters of the Styx have tumbled over the edge of the cliff and frozen into an enormous curtain of solid ice. The ground is scarcely visible, hazy with distance.

Thus far the archdevil is either ignorant of the cult or considers action against it not worth the resources\u2014or it is simply amused by its folly.

Whilst they represent unparalleled opportunities for study, they also devour the occasional student. Desperate fugitive souls and marauding adventurers fleeing {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s pursuit occasionally find their way to the Oasis and make demands of the arch-magister Elihandrel, though thus far his magical abilities have sufficed to return them to the archdevil's custody in short order. Sometimes conjurations called up by the mages themselves get loose and have a brief career of havoc before they're banished once more. But from the devils of the Nine Hells themselves, there is no threat. They're as obliging as the most unctuous servants.",

Whilst the appeal of studying the secrets of the Nine Hells is plain to evil mages and luminaries of all kinds, Elihandrel is very keen to maintain balance by attracting those of other aspects as well. He writes persuasively of the possibility of studying the heart of evil with an eye to countering its influences. One must truly understand a thing before one can defeat it, is his frequent refrain. Scholars visiting the Oasis from the mortal planes find the opportunities of the place overwhelming. There is always something new to learn\u2014and not just miserly scraps but the great truths of the universe hanging just out of reach like fruit ready to be plucked. Conversation with other resident scholars is transcendent, opening the doors of the mind. Very few ever want to leave once they arrive."
