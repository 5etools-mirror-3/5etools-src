						"The earth beneath Leya felt unusually warm. She reached down to confirm and pulled back in pain immediately. Her feathers were seared slightly. The season had been unusually dry, but this was a frightening temperature. After a closer look, it seemed like the ground was glowing.",
						"CRACK! Leya's eyes went to the sound. The large tree she'd played in as a child had fallen, and smoke rose from its remains. \"Go!\" her mind yelled, and she listened, rushing towards home. \"Get to them before\u2014\"",
						"Suddenly, flames burst forth, travelling at an unearthly velocity towards Leya's perch. Her perch meant the world to her, but in the vast expanse of the Wood it was small and unimportant. Too insignificant for a Perch Guard outpost of its own. Her heart tightened knowing the remote settlement wouldn't be warned in time, and that aid would not be close by.",
						"Leya's hands began to move without thought as she whispered the words of her grandmother. It wouldn't be enough, but she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she didn't try. When taught to her, the spell was meant to help farms through rainless seasons. It wasn't intended to be used defensively. Droplets of a lost cause formed between her fingers.",
						"Conjured water fell to the ground, evaporating as soon as it hit the steaming forest floor. As she concentrated, a strong warm gust touched Leya's face. It's Altus, it must be! Leya thought. The Amaranthine of storms was bringing rain to quench this hateful wildfire. She looked to the sky, frantically searching for more signs of changing weather.",
						"Barely able to register what she saw, her arms dropped to her sides in defeat. Flying balls of fire were filling up the sky. A swarm broke off, headed in her direction. Leya sank to her knees, hoping with her last thoughts that someone would save Humblewood before it all burned."

						"There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.",
						"The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS} has stirred the elemental {@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}, which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect's energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes."

Each time a character starts their turn under the ash they need to hold their breath (which they can do for 1+ their Constitution modifier's worth of minutes before they start to suffocate). This resets every time the creature surfaces, giving the character a chance to gasp for air. If a character cannot hold their breath, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking one level of {@condition exhaustion} on a failure.",

If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature's attacks.

Strictures in the Avium forbid her from practicing necromancy on campus, with the exception of reanimating those who wished to serve the College in death.",
						"Professor Nightseed seems nice enough, if a little strange, and she is a skilled necromancer. But the Professor is hiding a secret that makes her seem very suspicious, especially around the subject of the campus' servitor skeletons. She has been using these legal reanimations to practice new ways of imbuing simple undead creatures with greater faculties, on par with the living. This is gray-area work, definitely bending some of the strictures against necromancy at the Avium, if not breaking the rules outright, and it could cost the professor her job.",
						"If the party has the bones found in {@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|HWAitW|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}, Professor Nightseed will be able to tell them that the bones carry a strong aura of necromancy, something dark and sinister. It genuinely spooks her.",

Professor Nightseed's secret makes her nervous at this point, and she'll simply say she couldn't guess as to why this might be happening. Any player who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check will be able to tell that the professor is lying. Professor Nightseed won't discuss the subject further, and if the party pushes her she'll ask them to leave.",

						"The party will also notice a necromancy tome on the professor's bookshelf. This is the {@item Necronomicon Ex Corvis|HWCS}, out of which Odwald tore a page to cast his ritual in {@adventure Shadows Fall|HWAitW|4|Shadows Fall}, though it appears to have additional pages missing.

She will even go so far as to insist the party hand the book back to her so that she might bring it to the lower library, citing its danger in inexperienced hands.",
						"Should the party have read Glinda's notebook, they can confront her about her experiments. In this case, she will admit to some wrongdoing, but ask the party to keep her experiments a secret. As an expert on both the good and evil sides of necromancy, Professor Nightseed assures them that while her research is not strictly permitted, she is not using any sinister magics to achieve her results. She is simply researching ways to resurrect the dead at a lower cost of both materials and magical energy, and these experiments are key to crafting cutting-edge magics. The impressions remaining within the servitor skeletons may hold the solution to successfully completing her research.",

The professor will protest her innocence to the last.",

Dean Windsworth will give them another chance, however, as they are still the best hope at finding out who or what is causing these disturbances.",

Once enveloped, the aspect begins to lose its physical form, becoming one with the energy around it. Suddenly, the flow of energy is pulled back into the ritual circle. Immediately, the heat will dissipate and a wave of pressure will emanate from the circle, knocking anyone within 500 feet who is not inside of the circle {@condition prone}.",
								"For a moment there is calm, but during this time the mages still struggle. The energies that crackle from their hands feed into the circle, which once again begins to flare. The ritual has been enacted, but something is wrong. There isn't enough power. {@i The Borealus'} long confinement has left it too weak to provide the required energy. Reaching the required level of power can only be done at a cost: someone will need to give their life in order to complete the ritual.",

However, even if they do Odwald will insist upon being the one to give up his life. It was his mistakes that got the Wood into this mess, so in his eyes it's only fair that he forfeit his life. There is no time to argue, and if another character volunteers and refuses to back down, Odwald will appear to acquiesce, only to sacrifice himself at the last minute and save them. As the blaze of the ritual fire consumes him, Odwald will thank the hero for helping him find some measure of peace.",
								"{@b {@i If Odwald is dead,}} the Dean will offer to sacrifice himself, though he won't protest if a player takes his place.

While the Grove will remain part of Humblewood for the foreseeable future, the ash in its plains no longer burns with embers, reducing the frequency of fires in the Wood. The ashsnakes that appeared with the aspect remain, and have filled new niches in the ecology of the Grove, due to the snake's ability to survive on the energy of consumed elementals and beasts. The ashsnakes help keep some of the more dangerous fire-based creatures at bay. This has greatly helped the Tenders, who now see the ashsnakes as something to be respected from a distance, but not feared. Plants are growing on the lonely hill which marks the final resting place of the aspect of fire, and the sapling which sprouted from its top is quickly growing into a tree. It has been named \"The Healing Hill,\" and is watched over by the Tenders as a sacred site."
