								"The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.",

														"If you're running all four adventures in this book as a campaign, a character spots a small, oilskin-wrapped journal sitting atop a small stump. Water damage has rendered much of the journal unreadable, but what remains reveals sinister thoughts. It's clear that some nefarious personality has been experimenting with life-draining magic in the marsh and has been doing so for some time.",
														"The journal belonged to the evil {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}; it slipped out of his pocket while he practiced the corrupting magic that caused this academic year's mishaps. The journal notes that {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s last step in this scheme involved the Rose Stage Festival, so it's clear he has no more immediate plans to threaten campus. However, this isn't the end of his villainy\u2014the true extent becomes clear in later adventures.",
