						"According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons\u2014gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons\u2014red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat (Bahamut is often called the King of Metallic Dragons in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and Tiamat the Queen of Chromatic Dragons. In other worlds they have different names, and like all gods, they are beyond gender.)",
						"The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.",
						"In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.",
						"A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to harness this destructive magic. A bronze dragon named {@creature Runara|DoSI} pleaded with him to abandon his schemes. When he refused, {@creature Runara|DoSI} killed him, adding one more dragon grave to the island.",
						"{@creature Runara|DoSI} has grown weary of strife, and Stormwreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the cloister of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, {@creature Runara|DoSI} now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics.",

						"Ever since the violent death of a gold dragon on the rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle, the bone-strewn rocks have been the site of many shipwrecks through the centuries. One such shipwreck left a lasting mark on the island.",
						"About forty years ago, a ship named {@i Compass Rose} carrying passengers bound for the cloister wrecked on the shoal, killing all aboard. To the horror of the cloister's residents, those who drowned found their way ashore as shambling zombies. Since the loss of that ship, each new shipwreck has brought a fresh wave of zombie sailors to the island's shore. Fortunately, wrecks are rare\u2014or they were, until recently.",
						"Not long ago, a {@creature harpy} settled into the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}. With its magically entrancing voice, the harpy has been luring ships to crash on the shoal and feasting on the unlucky sailors. The sailors who escape the harpy's talons end up as zombies menacing the people of Dragon's Rest.",
						"The harpy is only the most immediate problem lurking in the wrecked hull of {@i Compass Rose}. The greater threat is a cursed talisman held in the ship's hold, imbued with magic by a long-dead sailor's desperate prayers to a demon lord. This curse is responsible for the drowned sailors animating as {@creature Zombie||zombies}. Most of the sailors who were aboard the ship when it wrecked are long gone, but some zombies have been trapped in the wreck for years.",
