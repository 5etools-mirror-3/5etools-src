By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.",

The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two.

The situation at the camp is confused and security is lax. Most of these raiders are mercenaries and bandits, and not even the dedicated cultists wear recognizable uniforms on raids. No one challenges latecomers for passwords or security signals. Put simply, the raiders are confident that no enemies followed them this far. Characters can walk straight into the camp without having their identities seriously challenged. In fact, the bolder they are, the more likely they are to blend right in.",

If characters are wearing Cult of the Dragon regalia taken from the rearguard, the characters have disadvantage on this roll because no one returning to camp at this time should be in uniform. The character who faced Cyanwrath one-on-one, however, has a -4 penalty to the roll. If that character ever comes face-to-face with the half-dragon, recognition is automatic.",

This check can be made only once for the group; they can't talk their way out of a failure. After the initial opportunity to enter the camp has passed, characters need to resort to stealth or subterfuge to get in. For example, characters scaling the plateau from the east could use brush for cover right up to where the cliff overlooks the camp. From there, they could observe or climb down the rocks under cover of darkness.",

If the camp goes on alert, every character must make a DC 15 Charisma check. A failure means the character has been spotted as a stranger and an infiltrator. Someone raises the hue and cry, which quickly draws a crowd. A roll of 10 or lower means someone has recognized the character from the fight in Greenest.

If they are currently unemployed, he offers them 150 gp apiece. He's willing to haggle; this mission is important, and no one else is available who Leosin believes can handle it. If the characters accept, he tells them to find him at the city of Elturel afterward, both to report and to collect their pay. If he has moved on before they reach the city, they can speak to the paladin {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} instead.",
				"The monk doesn't believe it's essential that the characters head back to the camp immediately. He doesn't expect the cultists to make any sudden changes in their plans or mode of operation. Leosin is wrong about this, because he doesn't realize how much his presence in Greenest alarmed the wyrmspeaker. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows that Leosin is investigating the Cult of the Dragon, but she doesn't know whether the monk's appearance in Greenest was a coincidence, a good guess, or a sign that the cult's whole plan has been compromised. She isn't willing to take chances: she's heading north with the accumulated treasure immediately.",

						"When characters return to the camp area, they find it mostly abandoned. (If they stayed, they witnessed the rapid packing up and abandonment of the camp.) The stinking huts of the kobolds (those on level 1) have been burned, but the level 2 huts and both guard towers remain. Anyone can determine from tracks that the cultists trekked away in small groups in all directions. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that most of the camp's wagons and pack animals moved in a train toward the west.",
						"Still left in the camp are some hunters, the kobolds who tend the dragon nursery in the caves, {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}, her guards, and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}. Only the hunters still use the huts. All others live in the hatchery cave. The activity and guards around the cave mouth should be the top draw on the characters' attention.",
						"On most mornings, hunters fan out onto the grassland to hunt for antelope and other large game. They travel on horseback and bring along an extra horse to pack the field-dressed game back to the camp. Hunters don't necessarily return to the camp every evening. They stay out until they have a load of meat to bring back. Hunting on the Greenfields is good, so they seldom need to spend more than a night or two away. Four {@creature Scout||scouts} act as hunters; roll a {@dice d4} to determine how many are in the camp when characters arrive. They are not dedicated cultists, so they won't challenge characters who enter the camp, attack them, or even alert the cultists. They consider standing guard to be beneath them.",
						"They are a taciturn bunch, so they won't be much help to inquisitive characters. They converse more freely with rangers, but to most strangers they merely nod, point, shake their heads, scowl, and utter one- or two-word answers. If characters converse with them, these hunters can relate how the camp dissolved within hours after the discovery of the captured half-elf's escape. Crates carried from the cave were loaded onto wagons or animals and hauled to the west. A few raiders remain in the cave: the Wearer of Purple (Mondath), the \"dragon-man\" (Cyanwrath), the better warriors, and the \"dragon-dogs\" (kobolds). As long as the cultists pay well for fresh meat, the trackers continue hunting for them. Whatever else the cave holds is none of their concern.",
						"A thorough search of the camp takes about ten man-hours. Allow characters to make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check after the first hour. A successful roll means the character realizes that while quite a bit of material has been left behind, it's all trash: cracked pottery, rusty knives, soiled clothing and bedding, cheap cookware, and wine that's gone to vinegar. Some of it might be of use to the people of Greenest who lost everything in fires, but it has no value as treasure."

The wagons would take twenty-five to thirty days for that trip, depending on conditions. The wagons pulled out at least a day ahead of the characters' return to the camp, and the characters probably spent a day exploring the abandoned camp and clearing out the dragon hatchery.

Erlanthar stays and makes one more appeal to their sense of honor and duty. If the characters still turn him down, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out a soft leather pouch, which he hands to one of the characters. Inside is a magnificent ruby worth 1,200 gp. He explains that if they take the mission, this ruby will be waiting for them in the hands of a Harper agent in Waterdeep.",

Baldur's Gate is situated on a prominent bluff next to the river, overlooking an excellent natural harbor. It is divided into three distinct segments: the Upper City where the richest and most influential citizens live and where the city's marketplace (the Wide) is located; the Lower City, which surrounds the harbor and where most of the city's merchants live and conduct their business; and the Outer City, which lies outside the walls and where most of the city's laborers reside in conditions that vary from crowded but clean to squalid.",

This is actually one of the reasons why Baldur's Gate is such a bustling commercial hub: for goods to pass through the city from south to north, for example, they must be unloaded in the Outer City east of the wall, carried through the city by porters on foot, and reloaded onto different wagons north of the city for the rest of their journey. No road conveniently bypasses the city\u2014a situation that the gate's profiteering intermediaries work hard to maintain. Most merchants find it easier to sell their loads to those intermediaries and consignment dealers when they reach Baldur's Gate, buy a new load of exotic goods from somewhere far away, and turn around and head back home, where they can again sell the new goods at a profit.",

They shouldn't hesitate to use him as a reference if a potential employer asks for one.",

The city's wealthy elite, however, often travel the streets in screened or curtained palanquins for both comfort and privacy. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does the same.

Secretly, its leaders seek to extend their shadowy fingers into every throne room and ruling council chamber in Faerûn. Like the Harpers, the Zhentarim too are aware that the Cult of the Dragon is on the move, and they need to know the cult's plans so they can prevent them from interfering with the Zhentarim's own plans, plus perhaps take advantage of the plunder possibilities.",
								"That's why Gleamsilver joins the caravan. The Black Network's spies learned that the cult is moving freight northward, and, like the characters, she was tasked with finding out what they're hauling and where it's headed. Those above her seriously considered wiping out the caravan with mercenaries disguised as bandits, ransacking the wagons, and torturing cult members for the desired information. Fortunately for the characters, Gleamsilver persuaded her superiors to give her a shot at uncovering the truth in a less bloody fashion. If she hasn't come up with something useful by the time the caravan reaches Waterdeep, she will put plan B\u2014the one involving mass murder\u2014into action.",

Snapjaw tries to communicate with the chosen character, but he doesn't want any of his comrades to know. He speaks enough pidgin Common to converse in simple terms, in case no one in the party speaks Draconic.",

If several lizardfolk are tied up and they're being questioned together, he could sprinkle words of Common into his Draconic replies, such as \"want to help\" and \"talk alone.\" If several lizardfolk are tied up and left alone for a few minutes, he could scratch a similar message into the ground. He might try provoking a character into a wrestling match or a duel (if your players are the type to take up such a challenge), and then whisper his message into the character's ear.",

						"Over a century ago, a half-elf wizard built a castle at the edge of the Mere of Dead Men. He lived there a relatively short time before the growing swamp flowed past the castle on all sides and made the location too remote for even his taste. After the structure sat abandoned for years, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers claimed it. They built an observatory into the top level of the keep, where they installed a piece of magic equipment called the {@i farseer of Illusk}. But the astrologers vanished mysteriously after a few years.",
						"After the disappearance of the astrologers, the castle again fell into disuse. It was built to withstand its cold, watery environment, so the encroaching water hasn't undermined the walls or flooded the dungeon. Over decades of abandonment, however, it filled with debris and attracted many unpleasant dwellers. Then {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} happened upon the castle on one of her trips into the mere to study and negotiate with the black dragon Voaraghamanthar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} suspected the castle could become a useful stronghold for her, being located so conveniently close to the lair of a black dragon. She explored the structure, cleared the giant spiders out of the tower, and forged an alliance with the nearby tribe of bullywugs.",
						"During that time, the half-dragon was still thinking of the castle simply as a fortified hideout. When she discovered the portal in the dungeon and learned that it connected to an abandoned lodge in the Graypeak Mountains, a new thought took shape. Lugging large amounts of treasure fifteen miles through the mere would not be easy, but if it cut 700 miles of wagon transport out of the picture, it would be worth the difficulty\u2014especially if bullywugs and lizardfolk did all the hard work. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} laid claim to both structures, turned the Graypeak Mountain hunting lodge over to a trusted Cult of the Dragon associate (a half-elf named Talis who now despises {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}\u2014see {@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}), and set about making Castle Naerytar an essential hub in the cult's treasure-amassing activity in the North.",

The only obstacle he sees between himself and his goal is the castle's current master, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}; the notion that someone might want to not live in a swamp has never entered Pharblex's narrow mind, and the bullywug seems deaf to Borngray's ironic and sarcastic jabs at the mere. When the time is right, Pharblex plans to remove the elf from the picture by any means necessary. It is unlikely that he would choose the middle of a battle against the characters, when he and Borngray are fighting side by side, to betray the elf\u2014but it's not impossible.

Under normal circumstances, they attack adventurers on sight, provided the bullywugs had superior numbers. They have grown accustomed to seeing cultists of many races coming and going around the castle, so when they see strangers, their first assumption is that the newcomers are more cultists. This assumption is reinforced if Snapjaw or other lizardfolk accompany the strangers or if the characters have any overtly cultish gear or clothing.",

										"The Scaly Death lizardfolk tribe has no leader. Pharblex killed its shaman, Suncaller, and the death left the tribe with an inferiority complex that was ripe for exploitation. When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} promised that Voaraghamanthar would reward the tribe's labors for the cult, the lizardfolk were ready to listen.",
										"Where the bullywugs fill the role of a static defense force, the lizardfolk perform five functions. First, they are the cult's laborers and porters. Lizardfolk did most of the heavy work while clearing debris from the castle, and they carry most of the treasure from the work camp to the castle on their backs and in their canoes. Second, they tend the giant lizards that are used to drag or carry especially heavy loads through the mere. Third, they do most of the hunting, fishing, and gathering to feed everyone at the castle. Fourth, they act as the castle's far-ranging scouts and outlying guards, since they are far superior to any bullywug at actively patrolling, ambushing, and laying traps. Fifth, a cadre of lizardfolk has been enlisted as elite guards for the castle itself. Borngray doesn't expect that any force would ever mount a real attack against the castle; it's too inaccessible, lying deep in the swamp. But if that unlikely event ever happened, he knows that the swaggering bullywugs would desert rather than fight an organized enemy. The lizardfolk, on the other hand, can be courageous and disciplined when they have a leader worth following. Borngray hopes to be that leader, at least to the small contingent of lizardfolk warriors he houses in the castle and rewards with special treatment. In exchange for their work, Borngray \"pays\" the tribe in metal weapons that are brought to the castle along with the loot.",
										"Meanwhile, the bullywugs boss and bully the lizardfolk, emboldened by their superior numbers, the lizardfolk's instinctive awe of Pharblex's magic, and the absence of any restraining sign from Borngray or from the lair of the black dragon. Voaraghamanthar's silence, more than anything else, makes the lizardfolk wonder whether fate is punishing them for some unknown transgression. They grumble, and occasionally a few desert, but most of them bear up with reptilian stoicism.",
										"Snapjaw is one of the few who has suggested rebelling against the hated bullywugs and the cultists. He hasn't done so openly, because that would invite retribution from the bullywugs, but he has spoken to a few fellow tribesfolk he trusts. Their response was interested but noncommittal; they intend to take revenge on the bullywugs, but not until the omens are right. Meanwhile, they endure\u2014and stockpile weapons. Borngray has only a rough idea of how many lizardfolk are in the tribe all together, and he hasn't kept close count over how many swords, spears, daggers, shields, and metal-tipped arrows have been turned over to them. The lizardfolk are much better armed at this point than they let on to either the bullywugs or the cultists. When the time comes to move against the bullywugs, the lizardfolk intend for every bullywug throat and belly to be slit open with a new, razor-sharp steel blade.",
										"Like the bullywugs, the lizardfolk's first assumption on seeing strangers is that they are cultists, or allies of the cultists, come to work or parley at the castle. They don't share the bullywugs' arrogance, however, so unless they are attacked, they don't really care who wanders through the camp. Lizardfolk on patrol or standing guard are an exception. They are alert, and they assume everyone is a potential enemy. They won't attack until they know for sure, lest they incur the wrath of {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} or Borngray for killing an ally. As outlying guards, their instructions are to alert the camp when strangers approach, keep the strangers under observation, and await further instructions.",

About half of them are in the vicinity of the castle at any given time; twenty-six live in the castle and the rest in reed huts (area 3).

While their concern over the murderous nature of other dragons is justified, the fact that they are two means they have little to fear from most solitary dragons. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} is working hard to persuade them that they could gain great power by revealing their secret at the strategically correct moment.

When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} first negotiated with the lizardfolk, they intended to move the entire village here, and built accordingly. As more bullywugs also flocked to the castle and the real situation became apparent, the warriors instructed their families to stay behind. Thus, they have far more longhouse space at the castle than they need. Characters observing the area from hiding and judging solely from the longhouses would estimate conservatively that over a hundred lizardfolk live at the castle.

When characters arrive, it is sitting quietly submerged in the muck, making it undetectable unless characters stir the foul-smelling stuff with poles. If someone steps into the muck or leaps to the steps, the otyugh lashes out with its tentacles. A {@condition grappled} character is dragged into the pit where, along with all the hazards of being savaged by an otyugh, there is the added danger of drowning. It's safe to assume that characters entering this tower will take a big gulp of clean air first, but the otyugh's attack might knock the wind out of them. Allow the attacked character to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 plus the damage caused by the otyugh's tentacle attack. A successful saving throw means the character has a lungful of air when dragged into the muck and can hold his or her breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + his or her Constitution modifier, with a minimum of 30 seconds (5 rounds). Failure means the character's lungs are empty, and the character falls {@condition unconscious} at the end of his or her turn after a number of rounds equal to the character's Constitution modifier unless the character breaks free from the otyugh's grasp before then.

								"The Stargazers converted the top level of the keep into an astrological observatory. The most interesting device they installed was a {@i farseer of Illusk}\u2014a telescope-like contraption that is useful for observing and studying heavenly bodies but which can also be used in a manner similar to an {@spell arcane eye} spell. In that mode, the {@i farseer} can view a location within fifty miles of it. Tuning and focusing the device this way calls for a considerable amount of skill and practice, and the device's dilapidated condition makes the process more difficult.",
								"Both {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Borngray visit this area frequently to study the {@i farseer}. The elf has had limited success with it, but {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} has mastered its use. Over the past year, she used the {@i farseer} to study Voaraghamanthar in the dragon's lair. During those spying sessions, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} discovered the dragon's secret twin.",
								"To protect this area, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} enlisted the service of four {@creature Gargoyle||gargoyles}. They perch day and night on the four corners of the keep's roof, where they can be seen from the ground and where they can see through windows into the observatory. Only {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Borngray know the gargoyles are alive. If anyone enters the observatory without being accompanied by one of the two cult officers, the gargoyles tear open the observatory's four ceiling hatches and attack. This is the only intrusion they respond to. The gargoyles don't interfere elsewhere without direct orders from {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, and she won't give such an order unless it is the direst of emergencies.",
								"A character who inspects the contents of the observatory recognizes the {@i farseer of Illusk} with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. After its true nature is ascertained, using it to view a distant location requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check and a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. If the Intelligence check fails, the desired location can't be found. If the Dexterity check fails, the image is too distorted to convey any information. If the Dexterity check result is 5 or less, a key part of the {@i farseer} breaks off, rendering the item inoperable.",
								"When characters find it, the {@i farseer} is focused on Waervaerendor's lair. This is a golden opportunity for characters to learn Voaraghamanthar's secret.",
								"Characters might try to take this item when they leave. The farseer is bulky (approximately 40 pounds) and fragile. Worst of all, it has suffered almost two centuries of neglect. The least amount of rough handling will shatter it. A team of brass-smiths and sages, working patiently, might be able to remove the device from Castle Naerytar intact, but adventurers working in haste have no chance."

				"Just as most adventurers don't walk into a dragon's lair without a plan, neither were D&D's iconic monsters developed without considerable forethought. This gallery explores some of the behind-the-scenes development that went into creating {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, as well as defining a spectrum of monsters, allies, and enemies that would feature in Dungeons & Dragons offerings for years to come.",
				"On the following pages, you'll find a number of images designed to serve as story beats in the larger {@i Tyranny of Dragons} campaign. These images were created to define impactful moments in a hypothetical {@i Tyranny of Dragons} tale, one which then could be explored by multiple teams over the course of multiple projects\u2014be they games, fiction, or otherwise. Some elements you'll recognize from the events of the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} adventures, while others were meant to provide inspiration for events parallel stories could detail.",
				"Beyond these, this gallery also includes a number of designs focused on threats integral to the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} campaign. This includes explorations of well-known Forgotten Realms villains, like the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay. The images herein show just a few avenues explored in updating these foes to the most current edition of the game, along with notes taken from internal concept and story documents. Some present ideas never fully expressed in {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, while others reveal deeper depths to adventure elements hiding whole conceptual icebergs. Certain components central to the adventure also see extensive exploration, like the garb of the Red Wizards, the iconography of the Cult of the Dragon, and\u2014of course\u2014the multiple deadly aspects of one of the campaign's central magic items, the {@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT}.",
				"Several other locations and characters also feature prominently in this collection, many being aspects of the Forgotten Realms or underpinning the wider D&D multiverse that have seen artistic evolutions over the years. The thorough design sketches of chromatic dragons, for example, hint at the depth of ecological detail that's gone into realizing D&D's most iconic monsters\u2014and foes central to the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} plot.",
				"How you choose to use this concept gallery is up to you. Perhaps these details will inspire you, just as they did the original {@i Tyranny of Dragons} designers. Maybe a particular image will resound with you, leading you to make your own addition to the wider campaign. Added insights on the tools and techniques of the adventure's villains can help you make them feel like more vital inhabitants of a wider world, while nuances of dragons and other can creatures aid in bringing these terrors to life. These pages might also be shared with players as you see fit, driving home the impact of the campaign's most climatic moments. Whether this gallery serves as a game aide or inspires your own designs, use it as you please, further detailing the existing adventures or exploring {@i Tyranny of Dragons} stories yet to be told!",
