				"Something evil is trapping the souls of the dead and draining life from all who have been raised from death by magic. This worldwide \"death curse\" not only prevents the raising of the dead but also causes creatures that were previously raised from the dead to wither and die. The source of this death curse lies in a trap-riddled tomb hidden beneath a lost city in the depths of a vast jungle.",
				"{@i Tomb of Annihilation} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure that takes place on the peninsula of Chult in the Forgotten Realms. Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcanoes. You can substitute a different jungle setting, changing location names as needed. Alternative D&D settings include the Amedio Jungle of Oerth, the Savage Coast of Mystara, the jungles of Xen'drik on Eberron, or a comparable setting on your home campaign world.",

						"The characters are drawn into the story by {@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}, a retired adventurer and merchant who, years ago, was raised from the dead. Now, she's withering away. When she consulted priests, Syndra learned that the affliction was widespread and that no spell could cure it. She spoke to her friends among the Harpers, who determined the source of the affliction: an ungodly necromantic device called the Soulmonger. The Harpers received their intelligence from a lich, but they don't know much about the Soulmonger other than its name and general whereabouts. Adventurers willing to help Syndra must travel to Chult, a land of jungles and monsters, to find the Soulmonger and destroy it.",
						"Unknown to Syndra and her allies, the Soulmonger is trapping the souls of the dead and depriving liches of the means to trap souls in their phylacteries. (The Soulmonger snatches up the souls before they can be trapped elsewhere.) Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, has sent operatives to Chult to steal the Soulmonger or, failing that, destroy it. Leading the Thayan expedition is Szass Tam's devoted lieutenant, {@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA}. Valindra has been warned that adventurers might cross her path, so she's prepared for them.",
						"Also lurking in the heart of Chult is {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}, a mythic, villainous figure among Chultans. {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} was a human paladin and a sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished. Rather than redeem himself, he raised an undead army to conquer Mezro. The would-be tyrant was defeated and banished once more. Mezro was later destroyed by the Spellplague (or so it seemed), during which {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} lost his power to create and command undead. He withdrew to the city of Omu, leaving the vestiges of his undead army to roam unchecked throughout the jungle. That was not the end of {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}, however. Bitter over his loss of power, he forged an alliance with the yuan-ti lurking in the ruins of Omu and underwent a ritual of transformation, becoming a yuan-ti malison. As a yuan-ti, {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} imposed his terrible will on the evil snake people and became their leader.",
						"Beneath the cracked and broken streets of Omu lies a secret yuan-ti temple called the Fane of the Night Serpent, where {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} holds sway and plots to bring about the end of the world. Omu is also home to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. As the characters explore this multilevel dungeon, they encounter the spirits of Omu's trickster gods and are potentially inhabited by them. Each god embodies a different alignment, and any character inhabited by one gains a special power as well as a flaw. The nine trickster gods don't get along, and they try to push one another out of the characters' bodies. As the gods fight over their living hosts, the characters must deal with the deadly traps and monsters that guard the Soulmonger. Venturing deeper into the tomb, they uncover clues about the dungeon's evil architect\u2014the archlich {@creature Acererak|ToA}\u2014and learn that the Soulmonger is feeding souls to an undead horror called an atropal. Once it consumes enough souls, the atropal will transform into an evil god.",
						"Destroying the Soulmonger ends the death curse affecting the world, while killing the atropal incurs the wrath of {@creature Acererak|ToA}. Under normal circumstances, the enraged archlich would be far too great a foe for mortal adventurers to overcome, but with the trickster gods of Omu on their side, the heroes have a fighting chance."

The whole city seems to be bustling, sweating, laughing, swearing, and singing."

								"Flowers, green plants, and vines grow everywhere, seeming to spring out of the building stones themselves. The profusion of greenery needs constant tending to prevent roots and shoots from damaging buildings or tile roofs.",
								"The city's defensive walls and towers are topped with colorful awnings to shield guards from the sun and rain.",
								"All streets within the city walls are paved with cobblestones or flagstones, and they have deep rain gutters as much as 2 feet wide. Residents of Port Nyanzaru pay little attention to any but the heaviest deluge.",
								"Tabaxi minstrels wander the streets, performing for anyone who tosses them a few coins.",
								"Walls divide the city into districts, and the open archways above the streets are painted with murals of dinosaurs, mountains, and mythic heroes.",
								"Crumbling ancient buildings covered with vines and lichens indicate the city's great age."
							]

						"The ground floors of most buildings are made of stucco-covered stone and have tiny windows to keep out the heat at street level. The upper floors have bamboo or thatch walls with enormous windows to let in the breeze, under broad thatched or tiled eaves. All buildings are richly decorated with paint, ivy, and vivid flowers. Some are painted in symmetrical, geometric patterns of straight lines and sharp angles, while others portray animals, monsters, landscapes, and heroes in a stylized manner unique to Chult. Where space permits, buildings traditionally include a walled yard or garden.",
						"All the city's water comes from rain, so every building has a cistern or wooden barrels to catch water running off the roof. Every public square is built around a fountain or rain basin. With so much water running downhill, Chultans also make excellent use of water-driven mechanical gadgets. Many buildings have water wheels built into their cisterns. Rainwater running through spouts or channels turns the wheel, which pumps water into pools, turns millstones, powers bellows or lathes or saws, or accomplishes any other labor-saving or amusing task Chultan engineers can dream up."

K'lahu (N female Chultan human {@creature thug}), a bookie who takes bets at Executioner's Run (see {@area area 2|036|x}), asks the adventurers to come with her as she collects a debt. The pay is 10 percent of whatever is collected on the 500 gp debt, which is owed by a man named Taban (N male Chultan human {@creature gladiator}). Taban refuses to pay anything until he's beaten down to 20 or fewer hit points, whereupon he offers up a pouch containing ten 50 gp gemstones. Ashamed by his defeat and eager to redeem himself, Taban offers to join the party as a follower, demanding no pay for the duration of the adventure.",
								"2. Create a Distraction at Fort Beluarian. Rokah (N male Chultan human {@creature spy}) works for the Zhentarim. The Zhents believe that pirates have formed an alliance with the Flaming Fist. Rokah has orders to infiltrate Fort Beluarian and find proof so that the Zhentarim can blackmail the fort's commander. He asks the adventurers to escort him safely to the fort and create a distraction so that he can ransack the commander's quarters. As a reward, Rokah offers to cover the cost of a charter of exploration (50 gp), which the characters will almost certainly need if they want to avoid future confrontations with the Flaming Fist. Rokah also offers to introduce the characters to two wilderness guides\u2014a pair tabaxi siblings named {@creature River Mist|ToA} and {@creature Flask of Wine|ToA} (see \"{@area Finding a Guide|08f|x}\")\u2014and pay the guides' fees.",
								"3. Escort a Priest to Camp Vengeance. Undril Silvertusk (LG female half-orc {@creature priest} of Torm with {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet) is a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet and newly arrived in Port Nyanzaru. She needs to deliver herself plus a packet of dispatches from her superiors to Commander {@creature Niles Breakbone|ToA} at Camp Vengeance. Undril was led to believe she could simply buy a horse in the city and ride to the camp, but now that she sees the terrain and conditions, that's clearly not possible. She hopes to join any expedition headed up the River Soshenstar. Undril is quite attached to her chain shirt, but she's not unreasonable when presented with good arguments for shedding the armor. If characters gain Undril's respect, she'll intercede strongly on their behalf if any difficulties arise with Commander Breakbone (as they're likely to, as discussed in {@area chapter 2|0cd|x}).",
								"4. Explore the Aldani Basin. Inete (LG female Chultan human {@creature acolyte} of Savras) has had disturbing visions of red-robed wizards operating a secret base somewhere in the Aldani Basin. The head of her temple, {@creature Grandfather Zitembe|ToA}, has too many other things on his mind, but he's given Inete permission to investigate. Inete would like to accompany the characters' expedition for safety, if characters are heading toward or through that region. She'll provide her own food and supplies, and \"donate\" another 100 gp to the expedition's expenses. She insists on stopping by the temple of Savras to gather her belongings and urges the characters to come along. If they do, the characters can meet {@creature Grandfather Zitembe|ToA} (see {@area area 7|03c|x}).",
								"5. Find {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}. A half-elf named {@creature Xandala|ToA} (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}) approaches the characters and claims to be {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}'s daughter. Feigning worry, she asks the characters to help her find him. Artus can't be found using magic, but {@creature Xandala|ToA} has heard that Artus left the city with a reptilian man who doesn't talk and smells funny. Both were last seen heading into the jungle. {@creature Xandala|ToA} wants the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} in Artus's possession, but she doesn't share this with the characters. Summerwise, {@creature Xandala|ToA}'s pet {@creature pseudodragon}, thinks the quest for the ring is too dangerous but has given up trying to talk sense into its mistress. Good-aligned characters might be able to turn Summerwise against {@creature Xandala|ToA}, or at least get information from it that they can use to thwart {@creature Xandala|ToA}'s plan or to aid Artus.",
								"6. Help a Dyeing Man. Omala (N male Chultan human {@creature commoner}) is a master colorist at the dye works (area 23). He recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye. Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society\u2014a grim warning. He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayoth√©, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit. Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone (see {@area area 4|039|x}), where he plans to beg for Kwayoth√©'s forgiveness. He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayoth√© is willing to forgive Omala's lapse in judgment provided the characters agree to kill a man named {@creature Shago|ToA} within the next 10 days\u2014no questions asked\u2014and speak of the deed to no one. Kwayoth√© tells them that {@creature Shago|ToA} works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayoth√© has Omala sentenced to Executioner's Run (see {@area area 2|036|x}) for his crime.",
								"7. Help the Lords' Alliance. Lerek Dashlynd (LN male Illuskan human {@creature spy}), an agent of the Lords' Alliance, offers to trade a sailing ship for an accurate map of Chult that shows the exact location of the ruins of Nangalore and Orolunga. Lerek represents wealthy Waterdhavian interests, and the offer is genuine. If the characters present such a map, Lerek has a cleric cast {@spell augury} before agreeing to buy it, to make sure he's not buying a fake. Once he's convinced that the map is genuine, Lerek arranges to have the promised ship arrive in 10 days.",
								"8. Hunt Pirates. The harbormaster, {@creature Zindar|ToA} (see {@area area 13|043|x} and {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}), is a secret member of the Ytepka Society. He knows that three pirate captains are attacking merchant ships heading to and from the Bay of Chult. The pirate ships are called the {@i Dragonfang}, the {@i Emerald Eye}, and the {@i Stirge}. {@creature Zindar|ToA} has permission from the merchant princes to offer a bounty of 2,000 gp for each pirate ship that is captured and brought into port, and a bonus 500 gp for the capture of each pirate captain.",
								"9. Save an Innocent Man. Belym (LG male Chultan human {@creature commoner}) is distraught because his husband, Draza (LG male Chultan {@creature commoner}), has been sentenced to Executioner's Run for stealing. Belym asserts that his husband was a victim of mistaken identity and sentenced without a proper hearing or trial. He's been unable to persuade anyone in authority that Draza is innocent. He'll give the characters 25 sp (all his savings) if they can help Draza from the sidelines so he survives the run. Draza is about to be thrown into the pit with a pair of {@creature Velociraptor|VGM|velociraptors}, so the characters must act quickly. Both the authorities and the gamblers take a dim view of interference."

						"10. Seek Wisdom at Orolunga. Eshek (NG male Chultan human {@creature acolyte} of Savras) stumbles up to the characters in the street and whispers, \"Speak to the wise guardian of Orolunga, east of Mbala. She can direct you to that which you seek.\" Then he collapses, {@condition unconscious}. When he awakens moments later, Eshek has no memory of the last 12 hours aside from a driving need to find people matching the characters' descriptions. He's as puzzled by what just happened as the characters probably are, but he'll help them however he can. At the very least, he knows where Mbala is from speaking to porters who've been to Camp Vengeance."

Burgeoning wealth has driven the city's richest residents to raise defenses against the jungle's dangers, and possibly against the dangers they perceive from the city's less-well-off districts, which all lie outside the main wall. The walls are impressive barriers of massive, fitted stone. Like other structures in Port Nyanzaru, they're decorated with colorful paintings of geometric designs, animals, and mythic figures.",
						"The city is defined by four steep hills. The westernmost hill, called Temple Hill because it's home to the temple of Savras, is completely walled off from lower ground. A wide stone bridge crosses on arched columns from Temple Hill to Throne Hill, site of Goldenthrone. A second bridge connects Throne Hill to the southern slopes, site of several merchant princes' villas. East of the harbor, the Hall of Gold gleams atop the city's tallest hill, Mount Sibasa, which is connected by bridge to the neighboring Yklwazi Hill (pronounced yick-ul-WAH-zee), site of the Grand Coliseum. Steep, stepped streets and terraces surround each hill.",
						"Outside the main walls are three slums: the Old City to the southwest, where many buildings are remnants of older, pyramidal construction; Malar's Throat to the south, where buildings cling to the walls of a lush canyon spanned by rope bridges; and Tiryki Anchorage to the southeast, where explorers and river folk gather.",
						"About half the city's population lives crowded together outside the walls, where they're always exposed to sudden attacks by carnivores or undead. A volunteer citizens' brigade keeps watch for approaching danger. When residents of the outer wards hear the long blast of warning horns, day or night, they scramble for the safety of the Market Ward and Merchants' Ward until the all clear sounds.",

								"There's enough happening in Port Nyanzaru that you won't need to rely on random encounters to keep things interesting. That being said, if the players seem restless, use the random encounters in {@adventure appendix B|ToA|7} to spice things up a bit as they're gathering supplies for their expedition. At any time, the party might run into Volothamp Geddarm (see \"{@area City Denizens|054|x}\"). Volo's familiarity with Port Nyanzaru makes him a font of useful information. If the party doesn't already have a wilderness guide, he advises characters to secure one before they enter the jungle. Volo might also suggest that characters partake in the dinosaur races (see \"{@area Things to Do|083|x}\").",

The dinosaurs are stoutly muzzled and have their claws and horns blunted in all but the unchained race.",

Most competitors in the two-legged race are hadrosauruses and deinonychuses (again with Small riders). The unchained race sees racers on anything, including young allosauruses and very young tyrannosauruses.",

It offers easy access by canoe to two major rivers, the Soshenstar and the Tiryki. Journeys up these rivers make excellent shake-down expeditions for explorers just learning the ropes of this unforgiving land. Characters can also strike out from Fort Beluarian or travel by ship to coastal landing sites such as Jahaka Bay, Kitcher's Inlet, Refuge Bay, Shilku Bay, and Snapping Turtle Bay.",
				"Chult is a land of adventure, and this chapter aims to make the characters' wilderness journey a memorable one. By design, the adventure locations are not tailored to characters of a specific level. If the adventuring party is relatively weak, it's up to the players to choose whether to flee instead of fight, negotiate instead of attack, or surrender instead of die. It's up to you as the DM to be flexible and keep the story moving forward as best you can. If an encounter is going badly for the adventurers, you can have the monsters suddenly withdraw, demand the party's surrender, or deal nonlethal damage. You can have an NPC show up to lend assistance. Mindless predators might be scared off by a sudden volcanic eruption or earth tremor. In short, there is always a way to turn the party's misfortune into a fighting chance of survival.",

To determine the minimum value in gold pieces Aremag will accept, roll {@dice 2d4 √ó 50} gp. As each fresh offering is displayed and added to the sack, the dragon turtle roars \"More!\" until the total reaches or exceeds its minimum. If characters act ridiculous about this\u2014adding only a pittance at a time, for example\u2014Aremag impatiently blows a blast of steam breath above the ship and slaps the hull with its tail, causing everyone not below deck to make a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw or tumble overboard. The bay is full of {@creature Reef Shark||reef sharks}, and anyone who stays in the water more than 3 rounds is attacked by {@dice 1d4} of them.",
								"Some negotiation is possible. A successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check can persuade Aremag that the passengers have no more to give, provided they've placed at least 50 gp of value into the sack. Only one character can make the check; others can aid, if they contribute a convincingly pitiable plea to the argument. The check is made with disadvantage if the sack contains less than 100 gp in value, or with advantage if the sack contains 150 gp or more. Every time this check is tried and failed, Aremag reacts as described above, as if characters were adding only a few gold pieces at a time.",
								"When the offering is sufficient, Aremag announces \"Heave it over!\" The bag can be tossed onto Aremag's craggy back, into his mouth, or directly into the water. The dragon turtle submerges without further talk, causing the ship to pitch and roll violently until the sea calms down. Characters can watch the enormous disk of its shell swimming down into the clear water of the bay until it disappears in the lightless depths."

										"You come upon an abandoned riverside camp strewn with wreckage. The tents are moldy and tattered, and all the permanent structures appear to have burned to the ground. Two intact rowboats are tied off to a short dock. North of the camp is a ridge, built into which is an 80-foot-tall stone statue carved to look like a man with a crocodile on his back. Between the statue's feet is a stone archway leading to a dark tunnel. To the left of the statue is a crude animal pen with a small, panicked bird running around inside it. There are no other signs of life."

								"When the Order of the Gauntlet first brought its war against undead to Chult, its members established this base camp (map 2.3) around an ancient Chultan shrine, which local guides call the House of the Crocodile. The shrine wasn't the focus of the order's activity, but it was an object of intense curiosity. Despite being in ruins, the shrine's traps were still active, and they overcame the order's attempts to reach the heart of the shrine.",
								"The overconfident visitors neglected to build defenses around the camp, believing that their own strong arms were sufficient protection. A couple months ago, they were proved tragically wrong when hundreds of undead swarmed out of the jungle and overran the camp. Only a handful of warriors escaped from that slaughter. No bodies remain in the camp; the remains of everyone who died defending it have either been buried by the second wave of templars (now at Camp Vengeance) or dragged away by jungle scavengers.",
								"When characters arrive, the camp is being watched by a party of Batiri goblins consisting of two {@creature Goblin||goblins} per player character. Leading the group is a {@creature goblin boss} named Yokka. The goblins wear wooden masks and hide in the foliage north of the camp. They believe the shrine is cursed, so they avoid it. However, Yokka had a vision of a treasure inside the shrine that could make him a great figure in his tribe, so he and his followers have spent the last tenday trying to work up the courage to tackle the shrine's traps. The arrival of adventurers is a great boon from Yokka's point of view. If they defeat the shrine's traps, he can simply take its treasure from them as they emerge. If they don't, they might at least weaken the shrine's defenses.",
								"Yokka's band bedevils the party without revealing its presence until the final moment. For example, if no guard is left to watch over the party's boats, the goblins steal them or knock holes in their bottoms. If all the party members enter the shrine, the goblins set up an ambush outside. If all else fails, the goblins use horns and animal calls to draw the attention of nearby undead ({@dice 1d8} {@creature Zombie||zombies} and {@dice 1d8} {@creature Skeleton||skeletons}) or aggressive beasts (a hungry {@creature allosaurus} and {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature Axe Beak||axe beaks}).",

Otherwise, they'll need to win over both Ord and Perne with persuasive arguments to avoid Breakbone's judgment. Each of them can be swayed with a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, but only if the character making the check has a sound case for leniency."

Ghouls and zombies threaten their existence, and grung poison is ineffective against the undead. Consequently, the grungs are strongly incentivized to use outsiders to solve their undead problem instead of making slaves or meals out of them.",

However, should the balance of power shift firmly to Krr'ook or Roark (see the \"Grungs of Dungrunglung\" sidebar), the grungs do not hesitate to tear Groak limb from limb in a cathartic frenzy.

The grungs attack and subdue characters who resist. If the adventurers accept, they are taken through the maze to the shrine, where they are received by King Groak.

Groak wants to be seen as a visionary and a romantic, and he loves to hear stories of the outside world. However, he threatens anyone who dares to question his inflated self-image. Groak tolerates adventurers as long as they entertain him, generally agree with everything he says, and are willing to aid him in his quest to realize his divine destiny to become Nangnang's consort.",
										"Krr'ook (red {@creature grung wildling|VGM}) is a grung priest who fears the king's madness. She whispers favorable signs and omens in the king's ear to keep in his good graces. Secretly, Krr'ook suspects that the Great Ritual to summon Nangnang will fail. Consequently, she fears for her life. She approaches the adventurers to see if they can help her fool the king on the night of the ritual. If Krr'ook senses anything out of kilter, or if the ritual goes awry, she scapegoats the adventurers and delivers them straight into the king's infantile wrath.",
										"Roark (orange {@creature grung elite warrior|VGM}) is a dutiful and dangerous grung warrior, dedicated to his mad king. Roark thinks all this goddess-summoning nonsense is distracting from the real issue at hand: defending Dungrunglung from the undead. Secretly, Roark's loyalty is to the tribe first and Groak second, but Roark is dutifully abiding the king's obsession for now.

She admires adventurers, and as long as the characters do nothing to antagonize her, she can provide them with useful advice and material aid against the myriad threats lurking in the jungle.",

If the characters are planning to explore the region between the east coast and the River Tiryki, or they've already been there and seen anything unusual, she'd be grateful for any light they can shed on the mystery.

No one (including the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru) has the force in Chult to dispute this claim. So within its territory, the Flaming Fist does as it pleases, including demanding that explorers buy charters. A charter grants permission to the holder to explore Chult and plunder its riches, but half of an expedition's proceeds and discoveries must be turned over to the Flaming Fist. The charter costs 50 gp, which is treated as a down payment on the split of profits. In addition, those who buy a charter can hire up to six Flaming Fist mercenaries ({@creature Guard||guards}) to accompany them for the very reasonable rate of 1 gp per tenday each. It's easy enough to launch an expedition from Port Nyanzaru without a charter. The only risk is that if a Flaming Fist patrol runs into an expedition without a charter, it will attack the expedition and confiscate its gear.",

Ships anchor a half-mile offshore, and people and supplies are ferried back and forth on rowboats. Six Flaming Fist {@creature Guard||guards} defend this station; their chief duty is rowing the boats back and forth. In case of danger, they can barricade themselves inside the stoutest log building or row out to sea until whatever threatens them loses interest and wanders away.",

It's the only bit of adamantine on the statue, and only the toughness of adamantine prevented it from being hammered out of all recognition. Once the adamantine fragment is picked out, a more careful search turns up a second fragment of gold, so thoroughly hammered that it's barely recognizable. These keys once unlocked the door to the treasury ({@area area 6|120|x}) and are beyond repair; so little of them remains that not even a {@spell mending} spell can fix them."

										"Seventeen-year-old {@creature Mwaxanar√©|ToA|Princess Mwaxanar√©} (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}) is the oldest living descendant of the royal families of Omu and the primary heir to the fallen kingdom. She and her six-year-old brother {@creature Na|ToA} (a noncombatant with AC 10 and 3 hit points) are guests of the aarakocra\u2014although \"wards\" might be a more accurate description. Their great-grandmother, Napaka, was the last ruling queen of Omu; their father, Omek, died in a fall, and their mother, Razaan, was killed by pterafolk. The aarakocra aim to protect the young royals (and their progeny, if necessary) until the evil in Omu is banished. The aarakocra say that they're doing this solely for the future of Chult, but {@creature Asharra|ToA} secretly hopes that the aarakocra will be elevated to key roles in any renewed Chultan kingdom, if and when it comes about.",
										"Mwaxanar√© is vain, headstrong, and impatient to claim her throne. She doesn't take kindly to backtalk and is unaccustomed to speaking to anyone except {@creature Asharra|ToA} without condescension. In her view, she's already Queen of Chult; the rest of the world is at fault for not acknowledging that.",
										"Unfortunately, the princess's whole life has been sheltered at Kir Sabal, so her understanding of the world beyond the monastery is woefully, almost comically, narrow and distorted. For example, she never refers to other kingdoms as anything but principalities or holdings (\"the holding of Waterdeep,\" \"the principality of Amn\"); she believes that the other rulers of Faer√ªn would send thousands of soldiers to her aid in a matter of days if they were aware of her need; and she's certain the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru will welcome her return and gladly hand over rulership of the city to their rightful monarch. The world as she understands it is tiny and hungry for her leadership. Mwaxanar√© isn't a fool; for the most part, these are things she's been taught by {@creature Asharra|ToA}.",
										"Mwaxanar√© believes she can garner widespread support to repopulate and rebuild Omu by retrieving a symbolically significant yet long-lost treasure called the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare (see {@area chapter 5|4c3|x}). If the characters claim to be headed to Omu, she urges them to find the chalice and return it to her \"for the good of Chult.\" If the characters request something more substantial as a reward, she offers them 250 gp worth of choice pieces from her private treasury (see {@area area 5|154|x}).",
										"Although the aarakocra treat her well, Mwaxanar√© is lonely; the only other human in Kir Sabal is her brother. Consequently, the princess is likely to fixate on one of the adventurers as a potential romantic partner. This attachment will be powerful, fiery, and jealous, and Mwaxanar√© is accustomed to getting everything she wants.",
										"Against {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s wishes, the princess forged a pact with the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, ancient beings of the Outer Planes, to become a fledgling warlock. She detests physical labor and puts her {@spell mage hand} and {@spell unseen servant} spells to constant use. Through her pact, she has also gained telepathy, which she enjoys using.",
										"If {@creature Asharra|ToA} suspects that Mwaxanar√© might learn disturbing or inconvenient truths about the world from the characters, or that her passion for one of them might lead to tragedy, they become a dangerous presence in {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s eyes\u2014and Kir Sabal is a precarious place for creatures without wings.",
										"{@creature Na|ToA} wears an aarakocra costume he made himself and pretends to be one of the bird folk. He is uncommonly studious and bookish for a six-year-old boy. He is polite, deferential, and speaks softly with a wisdom beyond his meager years. His only outdoor interests are walking among the gardens atop the plateau, where he studies plants and insects, and launching complex flying toys made of wood and folded paper out the window of his room and watching them glide lazily across the jungle. {@creature Na|ToA} would laugh, and then be aghast, if anyone suggested he would make a better monarch than Mwaxanar√©.",

If this happens while the characters are visiting Kir Sabal, the aarakocra appreciate whatever help the party can provide. The attacking force consists of ten gargoyles.

Zalkor√© cultivates hallucinogenic plants in the garden, because only in their narcotic, lotus dreams can she conjure up the face of her dead love.",

The eblis sent a marsh frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the froghemoth returned to Papazotl the eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.",

Ubtao asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and Moa the jaculi was too honest to lie. When Wongo the su-monster found out how Moa had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the jaculi and eat him up.",

Placing an object of equal weight to the puzzle cube (half a pound) on the pedestal prevents the gate closure and the release of gas.",
												"The gas fills the shrine for 1 minute, then dissipates. Any creature that starts its turn inside the shrine while the gas is present must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 10 ({@dice 3d6}) poison damage. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.",
