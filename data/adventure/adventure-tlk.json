				"To say this is a loosely constructed adventure may be an exaggeration of some degree. However, some patron saint of children requested a pdf of my adventure notes. So, here we are. I've use one version or another of this adventure to introduce people to the D&D experience as it has all the elements of a good game with very little ramp up time needed. The adventure structure is created in such a way to allow for as much or as little combat is desired. Encounters can be changed to suit a lvl1 campaign, and with a little imagination I imagine one could have fun altering it for a party in the high teens. Some nice paintings of Ancient Dragons and Neoliths may be in order.",

								"The walls of the cellar look different than that of the manor. Some still have old hieroglyphs depicting chultan dwarves. A history check of DC 14 will reveal that the manor was built on a much older foundation. Along one of the walls there is wine rack that is out of line with the rest in the cellar. Pushing it aside reveals a secret passage that leads outside, opening behind the Bucket's Bottom.",

Examples include: constantly drooling, seeming half asleep, zombie-like behavior, high paranoia, and the inability to control the volume of their voice.",

The Wizard Weirding does not sleep or eat (anything but brains) and often wanders the mansion. If the players see him and the Wizard is unaware of their presence, he will be levitating in the manner of a mind flayer rather than walking. If an alarm of any kind is raised, the Wizard will show up.",
