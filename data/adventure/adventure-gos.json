				"Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom's borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown's wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom's attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.",
				"The crown's benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes. With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes' raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals' hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.",
				"In time, Keoland's victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes\u2014but the conflict is by no means over.",
				"King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated. If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade.",
				"Saltmarsh, remote though it might be from the center of power in Keoland, is entering a new phase of its life as it reacts to the king's plans. The crown's agents want to expand the village's port and make it a prime location for trade with the world beyond. In another recent development, a band of dwarves\u2014bearing a decree from the king himself\u2014have arrived and begun to excavate the hills and seaside cliffs near town, looking for precious metals. If their work bears fruit as expected, the mine stands to become a major factor in the village's\u2014and, indeed, the entire region's\u2014prosperity.",
				"Naturally, not all of Saltmarsh's residents feel the same way about the recent developments in and around their community, which is the key issue that affects their lives and livelihood. Although the recent changes stand to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed. At the same time, as an undercurrent through all the goings-on, agents of the secretive and mysterious Scarlet Brotherhood work to thwart Keoland's ambitions while advancing their own.",

The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes' raids and have no desire to see the crown's ambitions lead to open war. The smugglers who operate in the area tend to be traditionalists. Most pose as merchants and rely on their local contacts to move goods through the region without interference from the town guard or royal agents. Smuggling has long been an easy way to make money in Saltmarsh, and locals generally look the other way, seeing it as a victimless crime.",
								"The traditionalists would like to see the dwarves' mining efforts fail and interest from the north wane, so that Saltmarsh's dependable fishing trade can thrive and the smugglers in the area are left alone. They resent the intrusion of outsiders seeking to transform Saltmarsh and undoubtedly drain power from the fishing families to give to dwarves and merchants.",

The exception is Keledek the Unspoken, the town wizard, who used magic to open the cellar door and found that the passages led to a hidden sea cave. He uses the cave as a meeting point for smugglers. He has recruited several {@creature Goblin||goblins} to keep watch over the place, along with a trained {@creature giant constrictor snake} he raised from a hatchling. The goblins barricaded several passages leading deeper into the dungeons after losing several of their number to {@creature Ghoul||ghouls} and {@creature Giant Rat||giant rats} that emerged from the depths.",

If the characters earn his trust, he might take them into his confidence. The details of the deep dungeons are left to the DM's invention."

He can vaguely describe the kitchen, the scullery, and the passage that leads to them from the back door, but he knows nothing else about the layout of the place.",

Recently, however, none have asked him to tell the tale, so once his tongue is loosened, he is eager to restore some of his lost prestige.

The characters then board the fishing boat, which is rowed out toward the ship. The journey to the ship takes 30 minutes (20 minutes with more than two rowing), but if the boat is to approach the {@i Sea Ghost} from the seaward side, another 5 minutes should be added.

								"With the exception of the minister in area 38, all the lizardfolk are initially mildly suspicious of the characters (though the intruders are obviously not sahuagin). They do not attack at first sight unless the characters have been seen committing an act that provokes their hostility. But the characters are curtly challenged and\u2014unless they think up a suitable story\u2014ordered to leave or surrender by word or gesture. Their refusal to do so automatically prompts an attack.",
								"In such an attack, the lizardfolk's first priority is the expulsion, rather than the death, of the intruders, but they fight to the death if provoked. Once the characters are identified as a threat, the only way to calm the lizardfolk's aggression is to call for a truce and parley with the queen. See \"{@area Parley and Surrender|1a3|x}\" below.",
								"If the entire lair were to mount a mass attack against the party, the characters would be quickly overwhelmed. Your job here is to find a balance and respond to the party's actions accordingly. If the characters try to communicate with the lizardfolk, even during battle, consider halting the combat and allowing the characters to exercise their social skills. The queen needs allies in the coming war and prefers to avoid violence, especially if doing so helps her ally with strong warriors.",

They jab their weapons toward the characters threateningly and attack within 2 rounds unless the characters can convey their nonhostile intentions. If the characters can't communicate verbally, they might accomplish this with placating gestures, such as sheathing their weapons. They will certainly get their point across if they throw down their weapons in a convincing gesture of submission.

						"The merchant prince Aubreck Drallion once counted himself among the richest folk of his city. His trade fleet was one of the largest and most prosperous of its kind, with hundreds of ships under his banner dodging storms, pirate raids, and aquatic monsters to carry goods across the world.",
						"Yet Aubreck's success perhaps came too fast and too easily; although his profits eventually stabilized, his ambition kept expanding. Years ago, his contacts in the southern jungles reported that he could monopolize trade in rare spices and herbs by making heavy investments in the area. Aubreck took the opportunity as a sure thing and leaped at the chance to get even richer. He sold off many of his assets and converted the proceeds to property deeds and promissory notes, then secured that portable wealth aboard {@i Emperor of the Waves}, the foremost ship in his fleet.",
						"Aubreck's plan was to convert these notes back into cash when the ship reached its destination in the south, but fate introduced a cruel twist, and {@i Emperor of the Waves} disappeared. A storm separated the ship from its escort, and it was never heard from again. Devastated by the financial loss, Aubreck was reduced to the lifestyle of an ordinary merchant.",
						"The true fate of {@i Emperor of the Waves} is known only to a few. The ship was nearly sunk in the storm that drove it off course, but it remained seaworthy. After the storm subsided, its surviving crew members dropped anchor near an uncharted island. When they came ashore to look for food and water, they discovered the island was inhabited by tribes of primitive humans, orcs, and goblins, ruled by cruel druids who worshiped Lolth in her aspect as the Queen of Spiders. The druids promptly had the few remaining sailors dispatched by their underlings and claimed the ship as a sign of favor from their dark goddess.",
						"In time, the island's population became fractured into two factions, each of which tried to exterminate the other. One group claimed custody of the ship and used it as a headquarters, stocking it with supplies and defending it from assaults by the enemy group. When the war entered its final throes, the ship was in danger of being overrun by the land-based forces. In response, rather than staying and fighting it out, the cultists aboard the ship pulled up anchor\u2014and thanks to an offshore wind, they rode the waves and left the island far behind.",
						"Fifteen days ago, Aubreck received word that {@i Emperor of the Waves} had been spotted adrift in the southern sea, apparently a ghost ship. The noble promptly used a sizable chunk of his savings to hire a ship and crew to sail to the derelict. Aubreck believes he can restore his standing if he recovers the deeds and documents that sailed with the ship. Now, all he needs are a few brave souls able to deal with whatever threats might present themselves aboard the {@i Emperor} and bring back his fortune."

Characters who survive those threats and push on find the lowest holds flooded with seawater and infested with undead.",

Ozymandius refuses to abandon the island, because doing so is deserving of a death sentence in the eyes of his superiors. The rest of the residents can be persuaded to leave peacefully, however, especially if the characters create a ruse to make it appear that Ozymandius or the cult leaders have given permission for them to do so.",
										"If a fight does break out after negotiation, most of the survivors are not eager to die. If Ozymandius and Ogmund are defeated, the veterans will surrender if Bayleaf is alive and capable of counseling them to do so. He also throws down his weapons or attempts to flee."

What terrible atrocities the undead captain might visit upon the nearby settlements are up to you.",

There, in the solitude of the inky deep, the aboleth made a second astounding discovery: a juvenile kraken with an unlikely, circular scar on its head, a wound earned in battle against a giant shark years ago. Even such a strange scar would normally be little more than a curiosity, but Sgothgah saw a pattern in this one that evoked thoughts of Tharizdun's dark madness. The aboleth took this event as a sign that Tharizdun had gifted it with the task of nurturing the kraken until it was fully grown.",

At the same time, the aboleth transformed the underwater pit where the kraken rests into a conduit for dark magic, fashioned to capture the plentiful negative emotions of the residents of the Styes. For months now, all their fear, sadness, despair, hatred, and anger has been focused into the pit to enhance and accelerate the kraken's growth.",
								"To maximize the effect of that emotional darkness, the aboleth chose a local human fisher named Jarme Loveage to be an instrument of murder and fear. Sgothgah enslaved the young man and has compelled him to commit brutal murders, fueling dread in the district. Jarme carries a lantern on all his grisly nocturnal harvests, and his horrible work has long been attributed to a faceless terror called \"the Lantern Ghost.\"",

In his mind, he saw ravenous, tentacled creatures devouring the Styes and the city beyond, and he scrawled these images onto the walls of his cell in the asylum where he spent his last days. Not even the pleas of his sister and a local priest named {@creature Master Refrum|GoS|Refrum} were enough to save him. Only yesterday, Jarme Loveage dangled from the executioner's noose.",

Rumors already spreading through the Styes talk of a young fisher named Raif turning up dead the morning after Jarme's execution. The authorities were quick to ship the body to the mortuary for cremation, as if trying to cover up the event\u2014and Refrum sees this as evidence that a sinister conspiracy in the Styes has some connection to the Lantern Ghost killings.",

When Jarme was caught, they used their influence to have him executed quickly. Now Refrum fears that the conspirators are not only free to continue their work\u2014but that they know he's onto them.",
										"Refrum believes that the authorities are watching him. Moreover, his notoriety as a thorn in the side of the council means that many people are afraid to talk to him. As such, he believes that the characters will be able to gain access to information and witnesses that he can't. The priest suggests that they start their investigation at Hopene'er Asylum ({@area area 11|4c0|x} and below), where Jarme was held for a few days after his capture. Refrum also recommends that the characters track down and speak with Constable Jute, the militia guard who found Jarme crouched over his victim. She can be contacted at the district garrison ({@area area 4|4b9|x} and below).",
										"Refrum intends to leave the Styes and spend a few weeks in hiding for his own safety. Any Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check made to assess the priest confirms that he is honestly afraid that his investigation into the murders has made him a target of the conspirators."

The glyph with which Sgothgah branded the creature takes the form of a blue-black mark resembling the spiral sign of Tharizdun. The flesh surrounding the spiral is scarred by ulcers and sores; the energy channeled into it sometimes erupts spontaneously and rots away its flesh.",

It was content to let Sgothgah serve its needs as it grew, but it had already decided to kill the aboleth once Sgothgah's usefulness had run its course.

Otherwise, a character who has proficiency in {@skill Arcana} who studies the glyph for a few minutes and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check determines its purpose.",
												"The pit's magic acts as a beacon for negative emotional energy generated within five miles of it, drawing wisps of all such energy from the dismal environment of the Styes. Channeled through the unholy symbol of Tharizdun that the kraken bears, that energy accelerates the kraken's growth and fuels its hostility. Normally such a beast would take decades to reach maturity, but Sgothgah's magic has reduced that time to mere months\u2014and now the kraken will reach maturity in only a few weeks unless it is destroyed.",

The cultists of Tharizdun are able to foresee the kraken's strikes and can appease it with sacrifices, and their status in the district quickly improves. Eventually, the cult leaders replace the councillors as rulers of the Styes. Defeating the kraken and its growing cult becomes much more difficult at that point, though it could make for an exciting follow-up adventure.",

Some time after the kraken's defeat, the councillors hold a closed meeting and decide to reward the characters: each receives a small teak coffer containing pearls and other gems worth 3,000 gp, on the condition that they do not speak publicly about their efforts.",
						"If any of the aboleths survive, those creatures have long memories, and are certain to seek revenge against characters who wronged them. This is especially true of Sgothgah. Alternatively, if the characters came to an agreement with the aboleths of the Endless Nadir and aided them in their mission, they might be able to call in a favor in the future. The aboleths' alien nature, however, means that their idea of repaying a favor might not necessarily match that of the characters.",

The dire, apocalyptic events that might be triggered by a gargantuan monstrosity whose mind has been poisoned by negative energy and the constant nightmares of Tharizdun are left for you to imagine."

The kraken would visit the town once every decade, giving orders and taking treasure as tribute from the people before descending into the deep to slumber. Malek Trandence, a priest of Procan, visited Warthalkeel and persuaded the people to worship the god of the sea. When Vaalastroth next returned, the kraken was furious at the people's betrayal. Vaalastroth broke the cliff beneath Warthalkeel, sending the town into the water. Rumors of hidden treasure and strange magic in the town's ruins sometimes attract explorers into the depths."

The change makes them dependent on water, which they must immerse themselves in regularly lest they experience painful\u2014and potentially lethal\u2014skin eruptions. Skum are bound to their aboleth master not just by their cursed state, but by a psychic bond that compels them to serve its every sinister whim.",

They infest corpses and piles of decaying matter and attack living creatures that disturb them. After burrowing into the flesh of a living creature, a rot grub instinctively chews its way toward the heart in order to kill its host.",
						"Rot grubs pose a threat both singly and as a swarm. See the accompanying stat block for the mechanics of a swarm of rot grubs.",
						"A single rot grub has no stat block. Any creature that comes into contact with one must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the rot grub burrows into the creature's flesh and deals 3 ({@dice 1d6}) piercing damage at the start of each of the host creature's turns. Applying fire to the wound before the end of the host creature's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the host and kills the infesting rot grub. After this time, the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target. Burning a body kills any rot grubs infesting it."
