The simplest approach is to steer the characters toward the NPC who will put them on the path you think they'll find most enjoyable. If they relish combat challenges, introduce them to the merchant Ginder Nanik, who pleads with the characters to go slay the dragon. Steer them to Catacus if they'd enjoy the treasure hunt of gathering ingredients to return the dragon to slumber, or local elders Javek and Vara Horn if they'd enjoy spending more time exploring the region. If your players want to interact with the various NPCs and weigh the different options these individuals present, then spend up to a whole game session in Arborean Springs playing out these interactions."
