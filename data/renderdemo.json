Faint runes in the ceiling and floor at both ends of the hallway are involved in the functioning of the portals. A creature must first use an action to examine a set of runes, then use a subsequent action to attempt to vandalize the runes. Each successful check reduces the sphere's damage by 11 ({@dice 2d10}), as the disrupted sphere loses speed moving through the failing portal.",
								"Alternatively, a set of runes can be disabled with three successful castings of {@spell dispel magic} ({@dc 19}) targeting any of the runes in the set.",
								"If the southern portal is destroyed, the sphere slams into the south wall and comes to a halt. It blocks the door to the tomb, but the characters can escape."
