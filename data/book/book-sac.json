No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.",
												"The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unplayable. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we chose for the current edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we embraced the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.",
												"In a typical D&D session, a DM makes numerous rules decisions\u2014some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn't clear or when one rule seems to contradict another.",

If you have access to more than one, you pick which one to use. For example, if you're a sorcerer/monk, you can use either Unarmored Defense or Draconic Resilience, not both. Similarly, a druid/ barbarian who transforms into a beast form that has natural armor can use either the beast's natural armor or Unarmored Defense (you aren't considered to be wearing armor when you use natural armor).",

														"Once you have your base AC, it can be temporarily modified by situational bonuses and penalties. For instance, having half cover gives you a +2 bonus to your AC, and three-quarters cover gives a +5 bonus. Spells sometimes modify AC as well. {@spell Shield of faith}, for example, grants a target a +2 bonus to AC until the spell ends.",
														"Magic items can also enhance your AC. Here are a few examples: {@item +1 chain mail} gives you an AC of 17, a {@item ring of protection} gives you a +1 bonus to AC no matter what you're wearing, and {@item bracers of defense} grant you a +2 bonus to AC if you're not wearing armor or using a shield."
