				"What is Dungeons & Dragons? For some, it's a dynamic narrative game with infinite possibilities; for others, an exciting tactical contest of strategy and wit. But for many, it is far more than a game; it's a way of life.",
				"If you're holding this book, then you probably love two things: D&D and sharing a great meal. And why shouldn't you? Few things go together so well: they're tabletop activities and highly social occasions, and both offer endless possibilities. But the similarities run far deeper. No matter where you are in the world, food is at the center of community and connection. For millions of fans, D&D plays very much the same role. You might say that D&D is the food of the imagination.",
				"Dungeons & Dragons is no ordinary game, and this is no ordinary cookbook; it's a uniquely D&D cookbook. Inside, you'll find familiar recipes and dishes that were only available to your D&D player characters, until now\u2014an adventure of food! We began this quest with a simple inquiry: how can food elevate and enhance the D&D experience? If the magic of D&D springs from its ability to activate the human imagination, then how can we recast that same enchantment over an inspiring set of recipes? In short, we want this book to be an essential part of your game nights. Why put out a bag of chips when you can prepare a batch of {@recipe Halfling Oatmeal Sweet Nibbles}? Or perhaps you're craving the same {@recipe Iron Rations} as your dungeon-delving character to sustain you through the game. Which protein will flavor your {@recipe Sword Coast Seafood Bouillabaisse}? Maybe you should roll for it. If you are new to the kitchen, try a lower-level recipe to start! Our goal is to stimulate the spirit of adventure at your gaming table and beyond by inviting you to enter a new culinary dimension.",
				"Here you will find a curated selection of D&D recipes spanning the vast multiverse. They are all delicious, easy to prepare, and composed of ingredients readily found in this realm. Even better, these recipes offer a unique opportunity to enhance the social experience that is D&D, whether it happens to be a game night or you just wish it were. Because D&D is bound only by the limits of the imagination, without an agreed-upon singular storyline or locale, we have organized this cookbook by one of the game's few ubiquitous devices: the multitude of playable fantasy groups featured in D&D's 5th edition. This structure invites D&D and fantasy lovers alike to eat like their favorite fictional cultures\u2014from elves and dwarves to orcs and drow\u2014while we shed fresh light on their stories via their unique cuisines and lifestyles.",
				"Dungeons & Dragons is about far more than monsters or treasure; it's built on the foundation of community, friendship, and imagination. This culinary compendium will inspire and encourage those same principles through the art and craft of cooking, while adding an exciting and visceral new layer to your game nights: sights, smells, touch, and, of course, {@i tastes}.",
				"So, what is Dungeons & Dragons? Join us as we find our answer through the dishes and cuisine that make this multiverse so delicious.",

						"The culinary canvas of the D&D multiverse is no different than the game itself: it's bound only by the imagination. However, Dungeons & Dragons is also rich with real-world influences, drawing heavily from our own past as well as fictional realms created by some of the world's greatest dreamers. Roast meats, hearty grains, cooked vegetables, and other familiar staples dominate the in-world menus from the castles of Krynn to the taverns of the Forgotten Realms of Toril. And while the worlds of D&D have many similarities to our own, unless you have a kitchen full of magical items, knowledge of powerful spells, and access to an array of mystical ingredients, you won't be able to prepare many of its recipes in their original forms. And let's be honest, many foods referenced in D&D materials are not quite right for the modern Earth palate (crisped worm skewers, anyone?).",
						"Fear not, brave adventurer! We've put together dishes that are not only true to their various worlds, but also tasty and possible to prepare here in ours. Can't find roth√© meat at the local butcher? Don't worry\u2014grass-fed beef or buffalo will do. Trying to find a substitute for cockatrice? Well, it's said that everything tastes like cockatrice, so chicken should suffice. Our methodology in creating this recipe collection was simple: find every notable dish, ingredient, and recipe in the D&D multiverse; curate and modify it for feasibility, appropriateness, and, most important, flavor; and present it here in a way that even a 1st level chef might be able to make it for game night. Accordingly, our master chef has not only provided easy-to-follow recipes but also some helpful \"Cook's Notes\" that will guide you through every aspect of the journey. \"So enjoy, and may the dice be good to you!\"",

You're locked in with an 11th level druid who can cast Heroes' Feast once per day, ensuring you certainly won't starve to death as the inscription had predicted.

Seemingly undaunted by climate and topography, human civilizations have thrived in all manner of environments, and with this diversity comes an eclectic array of culinary foodways. As by far the most common people throughout the multiverse, humans and their preferences tend to set the standard at taverns and other public eating establishments when it comes to portion size, flavor, and even the very design of the tables, seating, and flatware\u2014most of which are made to accommodate human size, human hands, and human sensibilities (sorry, halflings!). While dining etiquette, presentation, and ingredients used can vary wildly across the m√©lange of human cultures, one general constant seems to be the speed at which humans eat: fast. Among the most short-lived within the multiverse, humans generally seem to be in a rush while dining, no doubt eager to get back to ambitious plans of adventuring, or cultivation. This haste carries over to all aspects of their food preparation as well. Elves and dwarves, with their longer lifespans, might marinate their foods for weeks and braise their meats for days, but \"slow-cooking\" for humans means just a few hours, with most preparations completed in under an hour. However, this hurried nature does have its advantages; most culinary innovations, whether of physical or magical means, occur under the direction of a human, often in search of new efficiencies in preparation, or new dishes to concoct from whatever local ingredients are available.",
								"Among the youngest of cultures in the multiverse, humans in general are far less principled or traditional about their meals. Thus, their menus abound with variety in ingredients, preparation, and presentation. For example, humans of the coasts readily dine on trout, shrimp, squid, scallops, and mussels in a medley of soups, stews, and pastas, but it's not uncommon to also find the exact same ocean-sourced proteins grilled, beer-battered, baked, spit-roasted, pan-seared, smoked, saut√©ed, flamb√©ed, or even served raw. Similarly, these meals can just as easily show up on the finest porcelain and silver platters of castles and palaces as they do on the tin and wooden dishware of taverns located throughout the various worlds."

								"Most current human civilizations evolved out of ancestral nomadic cultures, and even today, humans are among the most well-traveled, capable of finding purchase in all types of environments. Accordingly, humans are just as likely to be hunters or adventurers as they would be farmers or foragers, and they do not tend to be fickle eaters. Animal-based protein is traditionally the desired focus of main courses, with beef, pork, lamb, fish, or chicken comprising the list of staples. However, meat is costly to procure or raise, so grains, vegetables, and fruits make up the bulk of most human meals. Human palates are far more a function of local availability than of any innate predisposition toward tastes. Humans bring their bravado to food, with adventure frequently taking precedent over tradition and function. In metropolises such as Waterdeep or Greyhawk, affluent urban dwellers might even sample monster meats such as baked stirges, roast manticore, or wyvern steaks purely for boasting rights. All flavors find their favor when the human palate is concerned. So, do humans prefer spicy or sweet; sour or salty; bitter or briny? The answer: Yes."

								"Barring magical means, food preservation is rudimentary and a common challenge for most of these transient people. Members of the higher classes have better means to keep ingredients fresh and thus more varied options for food preparation. Salted and dried meats, soups, stews, broths, and rations are stalwarts for the majority of human society. Most meals revolve around a protein, complemented with a starch of some sort, the usual being bread (wheat or rye) or rice, which is then paired with a local vegetable. Commoners will usually imbibe a form of beer, ale, or port, while the gentry generally favor whiskey or wine. Clean water is often a luxury, so alcohol serves as a safer beverage that also travels well.",

As a result, the human cupboard becomes that of the multiverse itself. With its strong agrarian roots, harvest is widely celebrated among human communities, with seasonal components providing a welcome source of change for these omnivores.

But not all nourishment is created equal, and elves are especially particular when it comes to what they will put in their bodies.

With elves, presentation and etiquette are paramount, and their food is every bit as elegant and graceful as its preparers and consumers. Hand-carved tables adorned with bowls made of marble, gold, and silver set the stage for a visual (and literal) feast of fruits, vegetables, breads, cheeses, and occasional meats\u2014a dream-like display where every imaginable color is represented.

								"Perhaps more than any other culture, the tastes, preferences, and palate of the elves are aligned with their lifestyle and firmly rooted in their beliefs. They are a lithe people and the foods they favor are fittingly light, fresh, and wholesome. They generally avoid preservatives and prefer fiber to fat; citrus to salt; and sweet to spicy. Even their iron rations, known as {@recipe quith-pa}, are made up entirely of dried fruits. Because they place such a strong value on life, a high percentage of elves stringently exercise food restrictions, and a great many would fall into the category of vegetarian, vegan, or pescatarian\u2014little that bleeds end up on elven plates. Even with these frequent restrictions, elven culinary mastery is renowned, and many humans who aspire to be gourmet chefs seek apprenticeship among elves.",
								"It is said that all elven subcultures are offshoots of the nomadic high elves who searched the worlds far and wide, choosing to settle in the lands that struck their fancy. Yet, elves are among the most diverse within the multiverse, with cultural variations playing a huge part of that diversity. High elves, such as Eladrin, Qualinesti, and Silvanesti, are the most refined, and insist on the finest-quality ingredients and visual perfection in their feasts. Because these communities are typically insulated and prosperous, they can afford to be choosier in their diets, even introducing complex yet wholesome sauces and garnishes to their dishes. High elves tend to align their diets most closely to their values, and prefer fruits, vegetables, and grains to meat and poultry. By contrast, wood elves are often wanderers and adventurers and, consequently, more disposed to hunting and foraging. These elves necessarily exhibit more flexibility in their diets, ranging from nuts and berries to wild game such as venison, turkey, and rabbit, and fish including salmon and trout. Wood elves also favor consuming whole foods, and relish individual ingredients from the land rather than blending different flavors.",
								"While most differences between elves are somewhat superficial, relegated to simple variations in dress, dwellings, culture, or beliefs, there are two notable exceptions that could almost be categorized as separate groups entirely: half-elves and drow.",
								"While half-elves are technically uncommon, their palate is effectively a blend of elven and human sensibilities. The environment in which half-elves are raised and reside ultimately determines where they fall on the culinary scale, but they typically build their diets with an elven base and venture into human accents and preparation techniques.",
								"Surface-dwelling elves and drow of the Underdark are as different as day and night, especially when it comes to their palates. However, one thing they share in common is a penchant for locally sourced, fresh (sometimes alive, in the case of the drow) ingredients. But unlike the forests of their cousins, the drow's Underdark is a veritable cornucopia of briny, sour, earthy, bitter, and tangy ingredients, from roots and worms to lurkers and fungi. Due to a low supply of salt in the Underdark, vinegars and acids flavor many dishes of the drow, who have as much affinity for meat and fish as they do produce, which for them consists mostly of fungi and tubers."

The elves that hunt do so thoughtfully, careful not to disrupt the delicate balance of nature.",

								"While dwarven dishes can sometimes taste one-note and homogenous to the uninitiated, their meals are surprisingly subtle to dwarven taste buds and can be a thoroughly well-rounded source of sustenance for various humanoids. However, few non-dwarves have ever tasted \"true\" dwarven cuisine, since most dwarven clans closely guard their secrets of the forge and the kitchen alike. Meanwhile, surface-dwelling dwarves are often savvy and resourceful, opting to incorporate locally sourced components\u2014be it indigenous grains or the most readily available root vegetables\u2014into their dishes in lieu of traditional ingredients. Nevertheless, their style of food remains constant, with savory and salty stews, marinated carved beasts, earthy root vegetables, and sauce-laden starches, all served in robust portions, dominating dwarven dinner tables alongside thick loaves of warm, dark bread for dipping and noshing. As for ales and mead, it's simply not a dwarven meal without them."

								"Dwarves are a stubborn lot...and so are their palates. Nevertheless, they begrudgingly see the sense in accommodating a range of tastes, especially when traveling away from their mountain homes in the company of a multicultural band of adventurers. But in their native environments, dwarves of the mountains, and especially the hills (occasionally referred to as shield and gold dwarves, respectively), live in self-sustaining, clan-based societies that harvest and store great quantities of grain and dry-aged meats, planning carefully for the unforeseen. There is little room for waste or the superfluous in their culture or appetite. Regardless of what world they occupy, be it Krynn, Toril, Oerth, Eberron, or elsewhere, dwarves of the multiverse tend to exemplify constant attributes and even more steadfast tastes.",
								"To that end, dwarven menus have evolved very little over the past millennia. Despite their well-documented obsession with all that shines, heritage is the one thing a dwarf values above any sum of mithral or precious gems and they do so with an almost hubristic commitment. Holidays and traditions such as Midwinter and Feast of the Moon remain dear to modern dwarves, and with them the requisite ceremonial dishes. Traveling dwarves are open to other types of food, (and they will never say no to a homemade meal), but they will proudly let you know how a dwarven touch, inevitably a savory one, might have improved it. More often than not, this just means taking a recipe and doubling the meat.",
								"Pragmatic to the core, dwarves enjoy food and appreciate the ritual of a shared meal, but they do not belabor over its importance or the small talk that goes with it, preferring to eat and get on with it. They love to feast, but reserve communal dining for celebrations; the everyday meal of a dwarf is consumed hastily while on the job. Wholesome, often one-course meals provide essential nourishment and brief repose for these unflinchingly hardworking beings, and such meals are packed and eaten with little ceremony. When dwarves do eat together, storytelling and seemingly never-ending songs often intersect with mealtime, providing a vital chance for elders to dispense lessons and learnings when a clan is gathered beside a great hearth at the same table. It is on such occasions that the fruits of dwarven mining and craftsmanship are on display in their elaborate engraved flatware made from the most precious metals, and the enormous clanking steins bristling with gems.",
								"Dwarves of the Underdark, commonly known as gray dwarves or duergar, have developed a fungi-based diet, since livestock and most vegetables are scantly available, let alone sustainable, below the surface. Duergar forage accordingly and have developed a nuanced tongue for fungal variances, and cleverly season the \"meat\" to stimulate, rather than modify, its natural flavors, favoring acidic, spicy, and briny flavors to salty or savory, based on the local availability of ingredients. They have a penchant for nurturing great fields of diverse mycological vegetation, complemented with tubers or roots.",
								"The other primary difference between surface-dwelling dwarves and duergar is the level of alcohol consumption. Hill and mountain dwarves have a legendary appetite for beer and ale, one so profound that it might be said that the food that accompanies them is an afterthought. Duergar appreciate the occasional drink but are not a celebratory lot. They imbibe in solemnity and considerable moderation. While duergar maintain their cousins' utilitarian ideals of harvesting and stockpiling basic available edibles, their distant kin, gully dwarves, have taken orthodox dwarven pragmatism to the next extreme, foregoing harvesting all together and scavenging without qualm."

								"A dwarven cupboard is often simple, well-organized, and deeply stocked. It's uncommon to see rare spices in the kitchen, with flavor additives erring on the tried and true. A common misconception about dwarves is that they lack adventurous culinary spirit or imagination, but in fact they have highly sensitive taste buds, often overwhelmed by bright, piquant, or saccharine flavors. They prefer their soups dense, their sauces thick, their meats long-aged or marinated over days, their vegetables roasted or saut√©ed (rarely raw), with salads and pescatarian options uncommon (save for duergar), though dried fruits and salted legumes might find their way into trail mix or iron rations. Although dwarves crave and utilize an immensely broad base of staples, key culinary decisions are often made by first choosing a stout and then selecting a main course to pair with it. And the dwarves' knack for a good liquor-meat pairing is usually on point, with their choice of drink serving to activate new flavors in the dish or, at minimum, enhance the inherent."

Unfortunately, this strong sense of hospitality sometimes goes unappreciated and unrewarded when boorish guests come by and deplete the larders of an overly polite halfling before the host can even sit or sample the meal for themselves."

								"Adventuring is not the true calling of most halflings\u2014the typical variety usually referred to as \"stouts\" or \"stronghearts\"\u2014but when it comes to food, they are as brave and adventurous as they come. Halflings will try virtually anything, from the new and experimental to the downright risky. They are not picky eaters, and their kind disposition shapes a nonjudgmental and forgiving, although not entirely undiscerning, palate. Can they find room for improvement? Sure, but is it really worth a trip all the way to the kitchen for the salt? They crave warm, rich flavors, both savory and sweet, such as cheddar, salted pork, vanilla, maple, walnuts, smoked almonds, butterscotch, and the like, usually served with a smooth, malty beverage. In a halfling household, just about anything can be enhanced by adding butter, eggs, and salt. It might be remarked that the diet of the average halfling will not result in an adventurer's waistline."

A halfling garden is indeed something to behold as every square inch is optimized to produce a tasty herb, vegetable, or fruit that will enhance their next meal\u2014farming and eating, longing and savoring. Halflings also raise livestock to assist with labor, transportation, and, of course, food. Pigs, chickens, cows, goats, and sheep are among the animals that often show up on the halfling table, but often in small quantities and with a high monetary, and sometimes emotional, price. With a few notable exceptions, such as the nomadic, dinosaur-riding Talenta Plains halflings of Khorvaire and the cannibalistic jungle variety of Athas, halflings tend to be a particularly cheerful and compassionate lot and hate to see any creature suffer. As such, it is not uncommon for a halfling farmer to befriend his livestock and end up buying his meat from one of his less merciful neighbors.",
								"Halflings are also famed for their proficiency at cheesemaking. Be it hard, soft, sharp, or mild, halflings excel at the fine art of artisanal dairy preservation...and consumption. Any respectable halfling gathering is sure to boast an assortment of uniquely crafted cheeses. Moreover, halflings are proud bakers\u2014skilled in all types of dough-making, ranging from fluffy morning buns to hearty loaves to delicately scrumptious desserts\u2014who bake in quantities with their community in mind. For these small folk, desserts are a way of life.",
								"Some particularly motivated or curious halflings do manage to leave the municipal boundaries of their villages and even hit the road of adventure. These wandering halflings, sometimes called \"lightfoots\" or \"tallfellows,\" tend to do so in groups, journeying from hamlets to Hommlet by wagon or boat, usually in search of various curiosities, unfamiliar foods being first among them. It is said, \"You can pull the halfling out of their shires, but you can't pull the shires out of the halfling.\" Such is the case with the adventuring types, carrying a strong sense of home with them wherever they go. And if you check their packs, you're bound to find more than a few effects of sentiment along with a disproportionate amount of food and ingredients from their hometowns."

								"The dragonborn philosophy around food is a simple one: kill it, grill it, eat it.

However, in stark contrast to their more solitary dragon cousins, dragonborn are humanoids who live in tight-knit, clan-based societies that prioritize honor, conduct (evil or good), and the welfare of the community above all things. As a result, dragonborn meals are communal affairs steeped in a surprising amount of formality and tradition. Huge family-style platters of assorted meats adorn fireproof, stone tables; while in some clans, dragonborn servers walk the feast halls with carving knives and heavy skewers of grilled or barbecued meats, serving up veritable buffets of generous savory chops.",

With feet as dexterous as their tongues, gnomes love to let loose, especially in the company of their compatriots. As with many humanoids, gnome cultures cherish regional variances; and with each of these differences come diverse cultures and palates.",
								"Rock gnomes, typically identified by their oversize proboscises (thought to enhance their taste buds), are the most common and familiar of the gnomes. They approach life with an easy demeanor and a graceful adaptability, traits prevalent in their culinary customs as well. Unfussy by nature, they are just as comfortable dining on human stew or an elven fritto misto as they are on goat cheese-stuffed mushrooms.",
								"Their brethren, the mysterious deep gnomes, are not. Svirfneblin, as they are known, are the most self-reliant and aloof of their kind, and often suffer an undeserved ill reputation because of their reclusiveness. Yet, these denizens of the Underdark are by no means evil or malicious, and they fuel their relentless pursuit of gemstones with a healthy yet simple diet of fresh fish, insects, and fungi.",
								"The tinker gnomes, also known as Minoi, are almost exclusively found on the planet Krynn. Their devout commitment to invention is a manifestation of all gnomes' innate curiosity, but taken to the extreme. Experimentation, often without thesis, is a recipe for disaster as well as great progress. This has sparked inspired techniques in food preparation (baking and sous vide techniques) and preservation. Gnomes of the forest will walk a far simpler path, shunning the outside world (even fellow gnomes) and embracing all that nature has to offer. They are the shyest of the gnomes, and their self-imposed isolation has most certainly informed their eating habits. Proficient hunters and gatherers, forest gnomes are extremely sensitive to their ecosystem, thriving on roots and vegetables and preferring to prepare their food raw (meat excluded) and thoughtfully.",
								"Gnomes feast and drink with aplomb, albeit with less variety than the others. Sweets and sugars are a rarity in the gnome diet, while spices and sauces are used sparingly, if at all. Traditional dairy products are usually not readily available, but some gnomes raise goats, which can yield butter, milk, and cheese. Yeast, both in bread and beverage making, is extremely uncommon. Gnomes do, however, excel at preparing meats and simple stews, as well as at foraging for fruits, vegetables, and various fungi."

								"Like a runaway applecart in Waterdeep, tiefling dishes can take you by surprise and knock you over with their bold flavors.

What changed when they were claimed by the Lord of the Nine Hells, however, was a physiological shift of their palates and preferences. An area not known for its cuisine, the Nine Hells traditionally serves blackened, boiled, and bland foods, not meant to be enjoyed by its inhabitants. As terrestrial beings, tieflings typically rebel against these flavorings and crave the opposite: salty, sweet, tangy, and, most of all, spicy foods\u2014robust flavors that cut through their charred taste buds and make them feel vigorous and alive.",
								"Of course, some tieflings are more in tune with their infernal inclinations than others, which not only influences their conduct but also their food choices. For these tieflings, raw meat, marrow, blood, and sometimes even minerals and coal are the preferred menu, while mysterious magical concoctions smelling of sulfur, ash, and oil may quench their thirst. Regardless of their alignments, it would be a mistake to pre-judge these sometimes unfamiliar foods and eating habits. Tieflings know flavor, which can make them great chefs\u2014provided you're willing to trust them enough to serve you."

						"Hot spiced cider is an essential seasonal drink with appeal to all seeking warm liquid refuge after a day on the trail. Fresh-pressed apple cider, usually sold by the jugful at marketplaces or farms, is simmered over a low fire or stove with allspice, cloves, brown sugar, and a burst of orange tossed in for measure before it's topped with fresh cream and a cinnamon stick. Halflings serve up their own special varietal named Moonslake, a minty, alcoholic apple cocktail that's been blended with a boiled and strained mint-crushed water yielding a biting, cool aftertaste (that humans tend not to enjoy). Elves prepare it clean, often cheesecloth strained, for a refined, glassy amber appearance. Dwarves aren't fussy, they just like it spiked. Regardless of your preference, savor one of these cool-weather concoctions to warm you from the inside out.",

While these recipes stand on their own merits, it's only natural that they might also serve to reward a hungry party who has just saved the day\u2014or to energize one who is about to.",

										"{@i Support.} If you are the Dungeon Master (DM), it might be best to leave the cooking to someone else. You are already doing all of the preparatory work for the adventure. Many DMs offer up their homes for play, and if you are hosting, you may feel responsible for keeping everyone else fed. So, players, show your thanks to the DM by volunteering to bring the food!",
										"If your group plays at your friendly local game store, or some other public space that likely does not have a full kitchen, you should think ahead. You might find a fridge and a microwave there that can hold a few Tupperware containers, if you are lucky. Some dishes that you can prepare ahead of time that will transport well to a game include the {@recipe Underdark Lotus with Fire Lichen Spread} or {@recipe Halfling Oatmeal Sweet Nibbles}. If you know you have an oven for heating up food when you get there, then you might consider bringing {@recipe Sword Coast Seafood Bouillabaisse} or {@recipe Chicken-Something Dumplings}.",
										"Don't forget that cooking and eating can both make a mess, but not all dishes are equally messy. Some recipes that don't require players to have their own plates and utensils include {@recipe Iron Rations}, {@recipe Hand Pies}, {@recipe Bytopian Shepherd's Bread}, and {@recipe Fried Fingers}. But wherever you are bringing the food, figure out how to deal with any leftovers, and how to avoid leaving a dish disaster in your wake.",
										"One fun way to use this cookbook is to try to match the food your group eats with the adventure you are playing. Experiencing the cuisine of a particular region of the Forgotten Realms, for example, can help players and DMs alike get immersed in the setting."

										"{@i Plan.} Plan serious meals for the beginning or end of a play session. If you are doing a real marathon, and you need to have a full meal in the middle, then take a break from the game. Some of the dishes in this cookbook, like {@recipe Quith-pa} and {@recipe Delzoun \"Tide-Me-Overs\"}, make for good snacks around the table, but if you're laying out a multicourse cornucopia, you're going to need the table space. As a rule of thumb, if you need to have utensils and plates to eat, then set the dice and character sheets aside until you're done. You don't want to have to fish a {@dice d4} out of your {@recipe Community Cheeses}.",
										"After all, there's nothing better than taking an hour after a D&D session to decompress with your friends over a refreshing dinner, chatting about the ups and downs of the adventure. These post-game sessions can actually make a big difference in your campaigns\u2014it helps everyone to get on the same page about game events, and it may even lead to some inspirations for the next session. And if your session runs all night, there are some great breakfast options in this book, like the {@recipe Stuffed Egg-Battered Toast}.",
										"There are a few ways to integrate eating into the play of D&D. If you know in advance that the party is going to attend a banquet, you can always arrange to have the meal ready for the players to enjoy in real-time as they roleplay their characters. This requires some coordination, but it can really bring the game world to life, along with a little mood lighting, music, and maybe even costumes.",
										"But if you're going to build a meal into your D&D session, you probably aren't going to be able to make it from scratch during a quick break. Choose dishes where most of the preparatory work can be done before the session starts, where it will only take a few minutes to heat things up and get them on the table. {@recipe Traveler's Stew} and {@recipe Potato Leek Soup} are examples of good choices where you can do a lot of the work beforehand and then heat them up at the last minute. You definitely want to avoid trying to make something such as {@recipe Pan-Fried Knucklehead Trout} while you are in the middle of a play session, because if you get distracted and leave it cooking for too long (like a knucklehead), it could easily get ruined and the smell of this rare aquatic treat will no doubt linger until next week's session."

										"{@i Improvise.} Every DM knows that sometimes you just have to wing it\u2014that rules are guidelines, and that to keep up the flow of play you may have to do what seems right rather than leafing through rulebooks. Every chef knows the same rule: you have to work with what you've got, and sometimes that means taking a path different than the printed recipe. Most important, these recipes are intended to inspire your creativity. Once you have a sense for the palate of each of the cultures and regions, you can use that as a building block for developing your own recipes in the spirit of these guidelines. If your group takes a liking to recipes such as {@recipe Elven Marruth}, why not try making a variation that captures the spirit of elven cuisine by fusing it with a bit of pulled pork or bacon?",
										"Once you get the hang of it, you can develop your own recipes. And if you are having trouble deciding between ingredients, remember that you are a D&D player\u2014you can always roll for it! For example, you could assign tofu, chicken, pork, and beef each to a number on a {@dice d4}. Give it a roll, and whatever number lands becomes the accompanying protein for those tasty {@recipe Kara-Tur Noodles}. But like any good DM, if the result of the die roll doesn't feel right, don't be afraid to exercise a little \"divine intervention\" and reroll. Sometimes it takes a die roll to tell you what your real preference would be."
