				"Can you name a tabletop activity that is highly social, builds community, and has infinite possibilities? If you said dining with friends, you're right. If you said Dungeons & Dragons, you're also right! Today, some fifty million people have played the game; D&D-inspired shows and movies top the charts; licensed D&D products fill retail shelves (ahem); and video games based on D&D's concepts rule the screens. In short, D&D is everywhere\u2014including the kitchen!",
				"Initially published in 1974, Dungeons & Dragons was the world's first role-playing game and would go on to revolutionize all aspects of the gaming industry and pop culture alongside it. It introduced an array of now-pervasive gaming concepts, from leveling up to gamified role assumption, but it notably held on to some aspects of its war-gaming past. Born out of a gaming culture that prized realistic simulation, the notion of needing food was inherent in the earliest versions of the game, usually represented in the simple tracking of weekly rations. To have any hope of surviving a protracted excursion in the dungeon underworld, you needed to stay fed. Simply put, in D&D, you must eat to live. But adventurers also needed a place to meet, carouse, and gather information, and what better venues to place in front of them than taverns, public houses, and other places of food and drink?",
				"As the game developed through different communities, food became a key part of the game's narrative experience. In many of the early modules, it was not uncommon for taverns to have long lists of food and drink from which adventurers could choose. For example, in the iconic {@i Keep on the Borderlands}, adventurers have the option of no less than five drinks and eight dishes, from honey mead and bark tea to pudding and roast joint. By the time the {@i Forgotten Realms} campaign world was in full force, there were entire books devoted to rating and discussing inns and dining establishments (thanks, Volo!). More cosmopolitan venues in the multiverse boasted restaurants that might seem worthy of a Michelin star or two.",
				"Why so many options for an element of realism that could just as simply check the box? Perhaps it's because early designers realized that food could provide new avenues for the narrative experience. Would a haughty aristocrat be content with iron rations? How well can that halfling hold her drink and what does she do when she doesn't? This is to say, the unexpected, memorable, and hilarious moments of any given D&D session are as likely to come up over an in-game tankard of {@recipe Neverwinter Nectar|HFFotM} as they are while battling a feisty gaggle of kobolds.",
				"In the first book, {@i Heroes' Feast: The Official D&D Cookbook}, we posed the question, \"How can food elevate and enhance the D&D experience?\" In {@book Heroes' Feast: Flavors of the Multiverse|HFFotM}, we ask, \"How can cooking and dining play an essential part of the communal gaming experience?\" The book that you are holding is both a guide to D&D food and a culinary companion to your game nights. It includes more than seventy-five delicious recipes, which you can enjoy alongside your in-game character. We've even created some food-loving characters of our own (once nameless adventurers taken straight from the cover of the first {@i Heroes' Feast}) whose madcap, multiversal adventures provide the locational basis for the dishes herein. Our hope is that this book not only adds a visceral and delicious element to your games but also becomes another avenue to connect with fellow gamers. So, in the immortal words of the original {@i Player's Handbook}, \"enjoy, and may the dice be good to you.\"",

						"Dungeons & Dragons is a game based on imagination, and so is this cookbook. But, of course, everything is spawned by something else, and the worlds of D&D are no different. From bustling port-side cities to sprawling pastoral landscapes, the game is full of real-world influences, and this is also true of what adventurers may eat. Whether your character frequents the taverns of the Forgotten Realms, the castles of Greyhawk, or the forests of Krynn, there's a good chance you'll see something familiar on the menu. That's because roast meats, hearty grains, and seasoned vegetables are as ubiquitous in the D&D multiverse as they are in our world. The main differences come in the specific ingredients that are used and the way they are prepared.",
						"One challenge that arises when trying to bring any aspect of D&D to life is feasibility. You may wonder, \"Do I need spells, magical items, and mystical ingredients to make this stuff?\" Rest assured, the answer is \"no.\" The chef and author team have spent countless hours ensuring that each dish is true to its D&D world but also possible to prepare with ingredients and techniques available in ours. We've even consulted the great archmage Mordenkainen, who has assured us that our substitutions and alternate techniques \"usually improve the dish\" (he's a curmudgeon and that's high praise from the Lord Mage of Greyhawk). When the original recipe calls for {@creature rothé|VGM}, we'll give you a reasonable analog, such as prime beef. {@creature Owlbear|MM} milk can be a bit hard to find in these parts, but not buttermilk, which offers a similar tang and texture. While the herring from the Rock of Bral may boast a unique flavor, North Atlantic smoked kipper is a suitable substitute. Ultimately, our approach to creating this collection of recipes was to collect and curate the most notable dishes in the D&D multiverse; adapt them for feasibility and flavor; and present them in a manner that even a first level chef might be able to prepare successfully. Accordingly, our master chef has not only conjured easy-to-follow recipes but also some helpful Cook's Notes, which will guide you through every aspect of the journey.",

This City of Doors, as Sigil is affectionately known to multiplanar travelers, serves as a conduit to the myriad worlds that comprise the D&D multiverse.

Though numerous planes are connected to Sigil\u2014such as the Astral and Prime Material Planes\u2014Sigil cannot be accessed by conventional travel and can be entered only via one of the many gateways that lead to the different worlds and planes. A city unlike any other, Sigil is crowded with structures stacked and layered upon themselves, while new buildings, courtyards, and streets are constantly being constructed, perpetually altering the city's already eclectic landscape.

						"Many examinations of early Yawning Portal menus have noted that its heavy, often greasy, fare had a celebratory \"last meal\" sense about it. This is likely because return from the Undermountain was simply not expected, with only the soiled dishware of stout adventurers left behind. However, as more adventurers survived the mad mage Halaster's labyrinth, the menu evolved to accommodate a balance of healthier options. Senior cook Jarandur Tallstand adapted the traditional wood-elven forest salad, or chopforest, as it has been called, to complement the heavier menu options with its mix of peppered leaves, olives, fennel, and tangy vinaigrette dressing. It is said that a chopforest delivered unto your table, compliments of Yawning Portal proprietor and Undermountain gatekeeper {@creature Durnan|WDH}, is a happy omen before one's descent to Undermountain.",

						"Popular at holiday gatherings of humans and elves alike, sornstag is a simmered venison dish that can be seasoned and prepared in a variety of ways. Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road.",

A specialty of halfling head-chef Chenna Fatrabbit and her human pastry sidekick, Klav Martilmur, this moist, yogurt-infused loaf is soaked in a delicious vanilla-almond syrup and topped with a sprinkle of salted almonds to add just the right amount of crunch. The dessert is so coveted that even Spelljammer pirates have occasionally dropped into port to bring a loaf or two back to Realmspace.",

						"Known as the unofficial capital of the former halfling nation of Luiren, Beluir was well regarded for its friendly folk, its strategic port location, and, of course, its food. The city's proximity to forests, rich farmland, and the sea made it an obvious destination for chefs and diners from across the Realms. And few dishes stood out more than Beluir's famous poached salmon. Available at virtually any eating house in town, the most traditional preparation came from the Friendly Burrow tavern, which created a mouthwatering spread, comprising both fresh and smoked salmon, herbs, cream cheese, and a touch of cayenne, served atop a baguette with a sprinkle of capers. If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining. While Luiren is no more, this famous dish can still be found on board various halfling-crewed spelljammers who commandeered this dish as their own.",

						"Blackbread is a palm-size circular loaf of pumpernickel that demands to be served warm and topped with sweet butter.

You aren't doing it right unless a sizable slab of salted yak butter or the like is slathered on top to melt into its deep, dark nooks. A fancier version, usually served as a meal in itself, has currants or dried fruits rolled in, providing an even chewier and heartier experience. Blackbread is often sold in loaves by the bunch, but they are equally delectable in a portable muffin form, as they are served at the Green Dragon Inn in the Free City of Greyhawk. Blackbread's versatility makes it a great day starter reheated in a skillet, with\u2014you guessed it\u2014additional butter glistening atop.

While any cherries will do, the cherries of choice originate from the same rustic archipelago where they ripen in the sandy island soil, which imbues them with a sweet, robust flavor.

The Wizard of Wines Vineyard is legendary for producing some of the finest wines throughout the planes and multiverse, such as the full-bodied Red Dragon Crush and the crisp Champagne du le Stomp. But not all wines that emerge from the mists of Barovia are of equal quality, as evidenced by the existence of Purple Grapemash No. 3. Priced at only three copper pieces per pint at most local taverns and other Domains of Dread, this table wine is known to be spectacularly unremarkable. However, in some areas of the Shadowfell, clever mixologists have added copious amounts of ice and lime juice to the pungent grape-ish mix, turning this otherwise mediocre concoction into a refreshing, slushy treat worth at least four copper pieces anywhere.",

						"Let it be known, silverfruit, also known as lychee or soapberry, makes for a truly heavenly pie. This medium-size, pink-skinned berry is known for being especially crisp and juicy, with hints of citrus and a floral aroma. But as a pie filling it's surprisingly creamy and custard-like, and it pairs wonderfully with a toasted, flaky crust. The Golden Bariaur Inn (in Sigil's Lady's Ward), which caters to highfalutin clientele from the Upper Planes, serves an astoundingly good slice of this silky dessert. Since Sigil has no natural resources, silverfruit is one of the many uniquely curated imports from the vast array of worlds to which the greater metropolis provides access.",

						"Kaeth, or coffee, is an aromatic brew made from ground roasted beans and is famous for its invigorating properties, making it a prevalent day starter throughout the worlds of the multiverse. In Sigil, the City of Doors, planar sightseers can sample from a wide array of coffee beans and beverages from countless planets. Kaeth, as it is commonly called on the planet Toril, has developed into quite the delicacy along the Sword Coast, where it is now imported in droves. In the nation of Sembia, a popular method of preparation features a blend of melted chocolate and liquor. In some areas, kaeth is so popular that it has become more profitable than the tea trade. The peoples of the planet Krynn drink tarbean tea and kefre, both of which are derived from vibrant, dark-roasted beans and frequently served black. In contrast, citizens of the Outer Planes imbibe numerous spiced and creamed variants of kaeth, including the notable Mountain Majesty of Mount Celestia. On the planet Oerth, coffee trends more acidic and is frequently blended into creamy liquors to grant an extra kick. But perhaps the most notable, kav'la, in which creamed coconut milk is swirled into a malted, dark, nutty roast, is served in tall, ornate ceramic vessels and is easily found in the cultured bazaars of Sigil. Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead.",

A simple concoction of clean, fresh water; mint; and sweet cucumber, it is served at upscale taverns, inns, and temples across the Prime Material Plane but is especially popular in the Feywild and upper planes, where a similar mixture forms naturally in many ponds, lakes, and streams. It's believed to have been invented by Faerûnian elves as a method of purifying water, using plants to remove toxins. Whatever its origin, it is sure to recharge trail-weary adventurers no matter what planet or plane they roam.",

						"Despite its promise of a \"banquet,\" the dish known as Eldeen Banquet is actually a hearty, one-dish meal sure to satisfy omnivores as much as vegetarians. Consisting of lightly breaded and fried eggplant topped with a warm, seasoned tomato sauce, this delight hails from the Eldeen Reaches, in the Khorvaire region of Eberron, which is noted for its robust forests and agriculture, and where the dish has occasionally migrated to the Feywild via a secret Fey Crossing. But while Eldeen Banquet is considered a regional delicacy, interpretations of the crispy, yet spongy, eggplant patty are common in esteemed eateries throughout the city of Sharn. High-end restaurants such as the Azure Gateway and the Celestial Vista, in the Skyway district, offer plates of Eldeen Banquet as delightful as their views. However, perhaps the best preparation is found in the unassuming Olladra's Arms, in the Hope's Peak district. Here, the portions are as generous as they are flavorful, ensuring the dish truly lives up to its moniker.",

Elves store their Elverquisst in crystal decanters capable of absorbing light and showcasing the tantalizing specks of gold dancing about in the rich claret mixture. According to legend, upon whispering a secret Elvish phrase, the sunlight streaming through the bottle will gather into thirteen points, resembling the constellation Correlian.

You may play epic sessions that start in the afternoon and run until the wee hours of the night. Or you may do lots of short, intensive episodes. Your adventures may be all about intrigue, or white-knuckle combat, or just light silly fun\u2014or they may explore the deep lore of the multiverse, searching for an ever-deeper understanding of the fantastic worlds that D&D opens up to us all.",
				"The adventures of the Bureau of Dark Tables are mostly wacky hijinks, but they also revolve around food. That doesn't mean anyone else's stories have to do the same, but every group's adventure in D&D should follow their bliss. One of the great joys of traveling in real life is to experience the cuisines of different cultures first-hand\u2014we live in a world where many things from distant lands can be shipped conveniently to our doorstep, but freshly prepared food, done in the style of its place of origin, is something you must travel to experience. The Bureau of Dark Tables are the sort of adventurers who know that, wherever your triumphs and perils take you, you haven't really been there unless you've taken in the local fare. Whatever your ostensible main quest may be, your side quest is always to level up your palate.",
				"In this book, there are recipes that can help you as a player to deepen your bond with both your characters and your gaming group. If you and your friends want to take your connection to the D&D multiverse into the culinary space, these recipes can become part of your game experience as well as your mealtimes. A refreshing {@recipe Ray of Frost|HFFotM} or a slice of {@recipe Laumberry Pie|HFFotM} can be as much of a reward as the experience points you get after an epic adventure.",

You are already doing all of the preparatory work for the adventure. Many DMs offer up their homes for play, and if you are hosting, you may feel responsible for keeping everyone else fed. So players, show your thanks to the DM by volunteering to bring the food!",
								"If your group plays at your local friendly game store, or some other public space that likely does not have a full kitchen, you should plan ahead. You might find a fridge and a microwave there that can hold a few Tupperware containers, if you are lucky. Some dishes you can prepare ahead of time that will transport well to a game include the {@recipe Halfling Iron Rations|HFFotM} or {@recipe Fig Cakes|HFFotM}. If you know you have an oven for heating up food when you get there, then you might consider bringing {@recipe Ornabra|HFFotM} or {@recipe Sensate Palate Cleanser|HFFotM}.",

Some recipes, such as {@recipe Tamarind Balls|HFFotM}, {@recipe Goldenstars|HFFotM}, and {@recipe Cloaks|HFFotM}, don't require players to have their own plates and utensils. But wherever you are bringing the food, have a plan for how to deal with any leftovers, and how not to leave a dish disaster in your wake.",
								"One fun way to use this cookbook is to try to match the food your group eats with the adventure you are playing. Whatever city of the D&D multiverse your party is visiting, or whichever wilderness you camp in, there are dishes that can put you in your character's shoes. You may not have the appetite to sample everything that the Bureau of Dark Tables eats as they make their way around Realmspace, but you can still make meals the centerpiece of your adventure."

								"{@i Plan.} Don't have a Total Planning Katastrophe. Schedule serious meals for the beginning or end of a play session. If you are doing a real marathon and you need to have a full meal in the middle, take a break from the game. Some of the dishes in this cookbook, like {@recipe Tavern Crickets|HFFotM} and {@recipe Black Lotus Root|HFFotM}, make for good snacks around the table, but if you're laying out a multi-course cornucopia, you're going to need the table space. As a rule of thumb, if you need to have utensils and plates out to eat, then set the dice and character sheets away until you're done. You don't want to have to fish a {@dice d4} out of your {@recipe Two Hares Inn Rabbit Stew|HFFotM}.",
								"There's nothing better than taking an hour after a D&D session to decompress with your friends over a refreshing dinner, chatting about the ups and downs of the day. These post-game sessions can actually make a big difference in your campaigns\u2014it helps everyone to get on the same page about game events, and it may even lead to some inspirations for the next session. And if your session runs all night, there are some great breakfast options in this book, like the {@recipe Green Onion Pancakes|HFFotM}.",
								"There are a few ways to integrate eating into the play of D&D. If you know in advance that the party is going to attend a banquet in Ravenloft, you can always arrange to have the meal ready for the players to enjoy in real-time as they role play their characters. This requires some coordination, but it can really bring the game world to life, with a little mood lighting, music, and maybe even costumes.",
								"But if you're going to build a meal into your D&D session, you probably aren't going to be able to make it from scratch during a quick break. Choose dishes where most of the preparatory work can be done before the session starts, where it will only take a few minutes to heat things up and get them on the table. {@recipe Duergar Smoked Herring|HFFotM} and {@recipe Boar Hock Soup|HFFotM} are examples of good choices where you can do a lot of the work beforehand and then heat them up at the last minute. You definitely want to avoid trying to make something like {@recipe Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish|HFFotM} while you are in the middle of a play session, because if you get distracted and leave it cooking for too long, it could easily burn and the smell of this rare aquatic treat will no doubt linger until next week's session."

								"{@i Improvise.} Every DM knows that sometimes you just have to wing it\u2014rules are guidelines, and to keep up the flow of play you may have to do what seems right rather than leafing through rulebooks. Every chef knows the same rule: You have to work with what you've got, and sometimes that means taking a different path than the printed recipe.",
								"Most importantly, these recipes are intended to inspire your creativity. It would be impossible to cram the flavors of the multiverse into this cookbook, or a whole series of them\u2014so take the recipes here as examples. Once you have a sense for the palates of the planes, you can use those as building blocks for developing your own recipes in the spirit of these guidelines.",
								"Once you get the hang of it, you can develop your own recipes. And if you are having trouble deciding between ingredients, remember that you are a D&D player: you can always roll for it! For example, you could assign tofu, chicken, pork, and beef each to a number on a {@dice d4}. Give it a roll, and whatever number lands becomes the accompanying protein for that tasty {@recipe Chopforest|HFFotM}. But like any good DM, if the result of the die roll doesn't feel right, don't be afraid to exercise a little \"divine intervention\" and reroll. Sometimes it takes a die roll to tell you what your real preference would be."
