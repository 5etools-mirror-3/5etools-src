						"This story began 50 years ago, and you're part of it. In the 1970s, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson created a game of make-believe that fused rules with storytelling. There'd never been anything like it: a game in which each player made their own fantasy character and teamed up with their friends to go on quests. One person served as the narrator and referee\u2014the Dungeon Master\u2014and did everything they could to challenge and delight the other players. That game was, of course, the first version of Dungeons & Dragons, and you're now reading its latest version.",
						"Over the decades, millions of people have played D&D, and scores of writers, game designers, and artists have made their mark on it through its various editions. When our team released the current edition in 2014, we were humbled by how many of you loved it. This revised version of it is a salute to all of you\u2014those of you who've been playing D&D for years, those of you who've contributed to the game through your feedback, and those of you who are about to experience the joy of playing it for the first time.",
						"As a teenager, I met both Gary and Dave. I even spent an entire day with Gary, and we did what all D&D fans do: share stories about our adventures in the D&D multiverse. I invite you to embark on such adventures anew. Share as much laughter as you can with your friends. Use only the rules that serve your fun, and always follow your group's bliss. So many people have been enjoying the magic of D&D for half a century. Let's keep it blazing for another 50 years!"

				"Fueled by imagination and rules, D&D invites you to adopt a fantasy persona\u2014a mighty Fighter, a cunning Rogue, a faithful Cleric, a magical Wizard, or something else\u2014and then solve problems, fight monsters, and visit wondrous places.",
				"There's no winning and losing in D&D, at least not the way those terms are usually understood. Together you and friends create an exciting story of adventurers who confront perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a tragic end. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the character's player might create a new character to carry on. No matter what happens, if everyone has a good time and creates a memorable story, they all win.",
