Each night, Astarion and Cazador's other vampire spawn delivered victims their master would feed upon and kill. To cope with Szarr's torments and the horrors of his undead life, Astarion armed himself with sardonic wit, flirtation, and a dark sense of humor. Decades of nocturnal hunts taught Astarion about all facets of vampiric life: secrets he's divulged herein.",

Employing these details, Astarion fans can adventure alongside their favorite vampire spawn, while all players can discover what lurks in the seediest corners of the vampire underworld."

And yes, I, Astarion Ancunín, one afflicted with a thirst for blood, provided every detail you're about to read.",
								"Isn't the irony delicious?",
								"As always, I have my reasons. You see, many vampires are particularly loathsome, and any of them might pose a threat to yours truly. So when I saw a vampire hunter stride into Rat's Run, my favorite little hovel of a tavern in Baldur's Gate, I concocted a brilliant plan. I charmed her, using all the old-fashioned techniques: the honeyed voice, the cocked brow, the hip swivel. And then I smiled, and the hunter glimpsed my fangs. Oh, you should have seen her face!",
								"Once we established that, yes, she could try to kill me with her nasty, little stake, we agreed on one thing: I'm a delight, but I'm not a real threat. And I have information that could help her bag some impressive bloodsuckers.",
								"So I told her every word you'll read in this tome. And then another brilliant idea dawned on me. I put quill to scroll.",
								"After all, don't my words deserve to echo in the hearts and minds of vampire hunters for generations? Gods be praised, we might finally be rid of the worst of our kind: the indiscreet, the devil worshipers, the demon harbingers, and the boring!",
								"I've consulted with scholarly types in Baldur's Gate, and they've suggested the formatting, editorial conventions, and other such mundanities you'll read in this tome. The result is a bit dry, so I've taken the liberty of punctuating the academia with some of my more arresting insights.",
