You can use the tiers of play, detailed in {@book chapter 2|XPHB|2} of the {@book Player's Handbook|XPHB}, as a guide to when these milestones might occur. Two detailed examples of epic destinies are provided below.",
								"An epic destiny is something the DM and player decide together. The character might reject their destiny, but the player knows what's coming and is on board. In fact, you and the player might plan that the character will try to reject their destiny! Nevertheless, an epic destiny is never set in stone, and if a player wants to change their character's destiny during the campaign, work with them to decide what that new destiny might be.",
								"The benefits associated with a character's epic destiny usually fall within the normal rules for character advancement and guidelines for character rewards. In other words, a character with an epic destiny doesn't have more feats than a character without one, and any magic items or supernatural gifts the character acquires should fall generally within the guidelines in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} for characters acquiring such rewards. However, you might decide otherwise. A character with an epic destiny might be more powerful than a traditional character, gaining an additional feat or acquiring a powerful magic item at a lower level than the guidelines suggest. Don't break the rules for just one character, though; every character in the party should receive such benefits at about the same time so no one feels left behind or pushed to the sideline. That said, making epic characters a bit more powerful can make your job as DM easier, since you can pit the party against significant challenges with less risk of character death."

								"You can also use your own knowledge of Realms lore to plant clues in the campaign that experts will recognize. When you use characters, locations, magic items, and adversaries from Forgotten Realms history, the Realms lore experts at your table will enjoy recognizing the Easter eggs you've placed. The adventure in {@adventure chapter 7|FRAiF-TLLoL} of this book, \"{@adventure The Lost Library of Lethchauntos|FRAiF-TLLoL},\" is a good example of this strategy. Lethchauntos is a very minor character in the history of the Forgotten Realms, but that just makes it all the more memorable when a player recognizes his name. At the same time, don't be afraid to play with expectations and keep the players guessing."

								"Faerûn has a reputation for being home to many powerful wizards and other characters. This can be an obstacle at the table if your players encounter a problem and expect an NPC like Laeral Silverhand, the Blackstaff, or Drizzt to swoop in and take care of things. Your characters might even try to locate and recruit such characters, hoping to use them to solve the party's problems.",
								"But it's important to keep the adventurers at the center of the story. The weight of Faerûn rests on their shoulders alone. No one else can solve their problems for them. If your players begin to ask, \"Where's the Chosen of Mystra, and why isn't she helping?\" here are some possible answers.",
								"Talk to your players about this issue. Stress that the campaign is about their characters, not illustrious NPCs. While characters in Waterdeep could call on the Blackstaff for aid, this sidelines the characters and makes them minor figures in their own story. Encourage players to tackle problems themselves and not give away the dramatic spotlight.",
								"Perhaps the characters have information no one else does, or perhaps they have a connection to the antagonist that makes the conflict personal. If the villain's plan is on a tight schedule, the characters might not have time to recruit help. Powerful archmages and rulers might not have the patience to listen to outlandish claims from a party of unknown adventurers, let alone believe them.",
								"Heroes in the Forgotten Realms often develop rivalries and grudges with villains who return again and again. Characters might discover when they try to recruit Laeral Silverhand to their cause that she's busy dealing with Myrkul\u2014again. And, because this sort of rivalry is well understood by famous NPCs in the setting, Laeral expects the characters to handle their villainous rival on their own, without interference from her or anyone else.",

They found the immense, primeval forest of Cormanthor, home to an ancient elf civilization. Eltargrim, leader of the elves at the time, created the Dales Compact: an agreement that stated in return for promising not to cut deeper into the forest, the Dalefolk were allowed to settle around the forest's edges or in places where the great trees didn't grow. Spellcasters from both sides worked together to raise the Standing Stone in the center of Cormanthor as a symbol of unity. Elves opened the city of Myth Drannor to the Dalefolk, and a golden age flourished for centuries.",

Eleven dales exist today, each with its own territory, government (or lack of it), militia, trading pacts, ambitions, and character.

But elves of Cormanthor had a different perspective on the Dales Compact. They viewed the influx of newcomers to the lands surrounding the forest as an inevitability. Thus, the Dales Compact was a means for elves to head off conflict with the Dalefolk, as any such conflict might overwhelm even the magic of {@area Myth Drannor|10e|x}.",

The Dalefolk's adherence to the terms of the Dales Compact assuaged the elves' fears of conquest, and in time the two sides formed a strong alliance. Elves fought alongside human heroes when Myth Drannor fell, and humans have earned their respect. Elves who remain in Cormanthor still work alongside Dalefolk to defend the region against threats."

Other folk of the Dalelands dismiss the people of Tasseldale as weak-willed compromisers who give in to Sembia's every demand in order to avoid being conquered. But those who dwell in Tasseldale know that Sembia can't be countered through force; diplomacy and strength of character will always win the day. This was proven true when Sembia invaded decades ago. When the effort stalled, Sembia sent in enough mercenaries to finish the job, but the cost in blood and treasure proved too high. About fifteen years ago, Sembia retreated from Tasseldale, returning the realm to independent rule.",

Zlan seeks to thaw the Underdark beneath Icewind Dale, releasing ancient monsters and exposing the ancient magical sites under the dale.",

While these dragons pose a physical threat, their natural ability to adopt the shape of any creature\u2014and their interest in lost and forgotten lore\u2014means they could be anywhere and anyone."

						"Calimshan, the Land of Wonders, is a rich realm that hides many secrets and fosters competing powers. Ancient lore lies buried here. Genie clans scheme and sabotage each other. Merchants, assassins, monsters, ancient relics, and cabals are as integral to Calimshan today as they are entwined in its history. Here, adventurers protect caravans traveling across the desert, quest for ancient mysteries, seek fame and fortune, collaborate with genies, and master potent magic.",
						"Calimshan is surrounded on three sides by water and relies on naval power for trade and security. Though desert takes up a third of its territory, Calimshan has many valuable resources. The forest of Mir grows cedar trees for shipbuilding. Quarries in the Marching Mountains mine precious stones. The seas provide pearls, seafood, and trade. At the center of everything is the fabulous city of Calimport, where people the world over come seeking rare goods, wealth, prestige, and opportunity. Calimport's gleaming temples attract countless worshipers and pilgrims, and its libraries are among the greatest in Faerûn.",
						"While the highest authority within Calimshan is the ruling sultana, the most respected profession is that of a clever merchant. Calimshan relies on trade and innovation to maintain its status as one of the wealthiest and most inspiring nations in Faerûn.",
						"Magic is ever present in Calimshan, and many citizens know a spell or two. Genies have influenced life in Calimshan for centuries, and people dwelling in the desert, steppes, forests, and mountains of Calimshan rely on elemental magic to survive. Legends of genies further Calimshan's reputation as a land of wishes and miracles.",
						"Calimshan's recent embrace of Mechanical Wonders\u2014first imported from the island nation of Lantan and innovated on by Calishite artificers and crafters\u2014has transformed life in Calimport. Made of porcelain, the lightest woods, delicate metal, and canvas, these devices are used for everything from transportation and war to civil engineering and household chores. They allow Calimport and other cities to solve magical problems without relying on the genies' magic.",
						"Whether visitors take the long trek across the Calim Desert or sail into Calimport's walled harbor, they inevitably end up in the city's bazaars. There, the breezy, melodic tongue of Alzhedo intermingles with languages from across the Realms. Dragonborn, gnomes, humans, and others barter over wondrous and mundane wares, negotiating the price of services big and small, licit and illicit."

The ornamentation and quality of the dagger, as well as how it is worn, indicates the wearer's status and position.",

But while Calimshan is entering a new era of prosperity, not all Calishites are wealthy. Many beggars in the cities go ignored by bustling Calishites seeking their own prosperity. Calishites often say, \"Fools fall the hardest. The wise stand up again.\"",

Each year, tribes gather in temporary tent cities to trade, share tales, engage in ceremonies, and set prices before venturing into the cities to sell their wares.",

They consider other tribes outside their own to be cousins and those who are outside the tribes to be strangers.

While Zengel sought out a powerful weapon to destroy the Twisted Rune, the cabal used the lure of arcane and royal power to convince Zengel's fourth son to assassinate him and the rest of the royal family.

With the aid of genies and her father's magic ring, Songal traveled to the floating towers of {@area Magis Tor|2c4|x}, where she claimed the {@i Staff of Life and Death}, a relic sacred to Kelemvor. She assembled an army of dragonborn and shattered the power of the Twisted Rune in an evening called the Night of Fleeing Shadows.",

The Moonshaes include seven major islands and over a hundred smaller ones, and a variety of cultures call these isles home. The story of the Moonshaes tells of peoples coming together to protect their homes, their family, and the sacred earth. Tragically, this unity came about only when the inhabitants were confronted with overwhelming danger, and that accord was purchased at great cost.",

The heart of the Earthmother's power lies in Myrloch Vale at the center of the island of Gwynneth, the most magical place in the Moonshaes.",

The archfey High Lady Ordalf arrived from the Feywild and claimed Gwynneth; the fey that dwelled there became her subjects. At the same time, the nation of Amn swept into the Moonshaes, laying claim to the realm's valuable natural resources. The simultaneous invasions shattered Derid's authority.",
						"Tragedy struck when Derid's son, Owaren, was imprisoned by Amn and later died during an escape attempt. High Lady Ordalf sympathized with Derid's grief, imagining the loss of her own son, Prince Araithe. The two nobles allied together against Amn. After the war, Prince Araithe married Derid's daughter, Tarilyn. Their daughter, Caitlyn Kendrick, is the heir of both high king and high lady. For many, the hope of a united Moonshaes rests on her."

Major roads along the Sword Coast and beyond meet where the wide and deep Chionthar River allows seagoing vessels easy access to Gray Harbor.",

Working people in the Lower City drive trade from roads and harbors. Refugees and poor residents make what homes they can in the Outer City. Sturdy walls and gates divide these three districts.",
						"Baldur's Gate has seen its share of dangers in recent years. Cultists of sinister gods promote murder, tyranny, and necromancy in shadowy lanes and hidden rooms. A powerful thieves' guild, so ubiquitous as to be known only as the Guild, lines its pockets at the expense of the citizenry and visitors. Innocent-seeming citizens secretly worship fiends or are fiends in disguise. Cargo from across the world provides the city with wonders and wealth, but it also conceals curses from distant lands. Danger and opportunity aplenty wait in the bustling city, and people who are smart or lucky can make a reputation and a fortune."

Defying expectation and tradition, Ulder refused to give up control of the Flaming Fist; he works hard to meet his governmental responsibilities and his military obligations. He's an inspiration to idealists who long for greater fairness and prosperity in the city, but Ulder has a hard time balancing his roles. While his leadership in the Council of Four is remarkably progressive and he has led the city through recent tribulations, his inattention to the Flaming Fist has allowed the mercenary company to slide further into oppression and brutality.",

The characters have less freedom to unleash destructive spells or effects, for fear of harming innocent people and their property. Just as the heroes can quickly call for allies, so too can urban villains. Particularly in intrigue adventures, people might not be who they seem, so the characters risk being betrayed. Characters in urban settings must keep their wits about them."

Inhuman villains typically try to appear sophisticated, such as an incubus that owns a profitable hostel or a sea hag with a penchant for frilly shirts.",

Cottle's Wainwright has produced and put into use more than a dozen of these conveyances, which appear to be elegant carriages. Most roam the Upper City, with occasional trips into the Lower City or even the Outer City to drum up interest. The distinctive carriages are causing quite a stir, even among the majority who don't know about their magical abilities.",
								"Cottle's carriages are uniform in appearance. They are flat black in color, with thick curtains obscuring the interior. Each has a basic carriage shape, complete with a driver, but the citywide ban on large animals means they aren't pulled by horses. Instead, an intangible magical force that manifests as illusory horses pulls each carriage at the same speed as a pair of normal horses. The interior is dark and comfortable, with the only unusual feature being a series of small dials built into the inner side of the door.",
								"Although anyone can pay a carriage driver for transport throughout the city, a person who pays for admittance and sets the proper combination on the dials can open the door to a different one of Cottle's carriages elsewhere in the city. Each carriage has a unique combination to receive teleporting riders. Cottle shares the combinations only with trusted patrons. Still, a few mathematically perspicacious riders have deduced Cottle's combinations and have learned to hack the system. Anyone in the know who's looking for quick passage might enter a carriage, spin the dials, and hope the door opens somewhere more hospitable.",
