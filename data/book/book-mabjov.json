								"Back when me and Boo caught the Calishite itch, Boo said we should start a journal. But his paws were tiny and ink got everywhere...including places that I should not write down here. So I, Minsc, decided to write down our adventures to prove that the pen is not mightier than the sword! With Boo's help, we wrote about every den of stinking evil that was found, every wicked butt that was kicked, and lots more besides!",
								"Me and Boo thought the journal would help other heroes see how good and fun it is to smash and smite evil, so we asked our friend Volo to publish it. But Volo said something about it being childlike gibberish and in need of an \"editor\". He said he would edit it for us, but only if we helped him out with a book he was writing. Why would Volo write a book on monsters? He has never gone butt-kicking in the name of righteousness! But me and Boo are always eager to help a friend, so monster hunting we went.",
								"Monster hunting was fun, as it always is. Boo has a nose that can sniff out evil, so sniffing out monsters was as easy for my little friend as sniffing out squirrels in heat. We mostly killed cockatrices and basilisks, because we hate creatures that turn you to stone. Being turned to stone is no fun. No fun at all.",
								"We returned to Volo with monster carcasses and our writings on the joy of giving evil the backhand of justice. Volo got all red in the face. He said something about how I ignored the \"list\" he had given me. I think he meant the paper that Boo used on his furry backside while we were on the road.",
								"It all worked out in the end. I just had to promise not to talk to our good friend Volo for one hundred years. But one hundred years can fly by when you're not looking. Me and Boo know this from experience..."

The influential organizations that run the city's economy\u2014such as the oppressive Cowled Wizards, the enigmatic Shadow Thieves, or the obscenely wealthy mercantile houses\u2014act with unfettered impunity, answering only to themselves. Those who fall on the lower rungs of the social ladder\u2014like the poor who dwell in the slums of the River District\u2014have no recourse to the authorities or the law.

						"Situated where the Western Heartlands meet the Sword Coast, the city-state of Baldur's Gate is a beacon of civilization in a largely untamed frontier land. Although somewhat small in terms of area, Baldur's Gate population rivals that of the highly regarded and influential Waterdeep to the north.",
						"Because Baldur's Gate is first and foremost a city of trade built around its harbor, the docks remain the true heart of the city. This busy area is the base of operations for many key trade organizations in Faerûn, including the famous mercenary company the Flaming Fist. Even the role of the city's leaders, the Council of Four (or the \"Grand Dukes\"), has mercantile origins and still pulls many of its members from the ranks of successful merchants.",
						"Often simply referred to as \"the Gate,\" especially by its residents\u2014Baldurians, as they're called\u2014Baldur's Gate was founded over 400 years ago. In those days, the settlement now known as Baldur's Gate was little more than a port with a surrounding shanty town. A combination of key historical figures and rapidly changing economic factors did much to shape the city within a relatively short amount of time.",
						"Baldur's Gate is named for perhaps its most famous citizen, the legendary explorer Balduran. With his ship, the Wandering Eye, Balduran and his crew became the first Faerûnians to reach the once-mythical continent of Anchorome after sailing west across the Trackless Sea. After many years, Balduran returned to his home harbor and invested his accumulated wealth in its growth.",
						"In this way, Balduran used the great fortune he amassed during his travels to help the small town that would someday bear his name grow into a major metropolis. His most famous project was the construction of the impressive city walls that helps make Baldur's Gate an island of security within the otherwise dangerous and unpredictable Sword Coast.",
						"After the walls' completion, Balduran set sail one final time with the intention of returning to and further exploring Anchorome. However, he and his crew were never heard from again, their ultimate fates still unknown to this day.",
						"As the years went by, the Gate's rapid growth and increasing prosperity have caught the attention and resentment from wealthy nobles and merchants in Waterdeep and Amn. Although their relationships are strained at times\u2014especially with Amn during the Iron Crisis\u2014this conflict remains a trade rivalry that has never broken out into open war.",
						"Baldur's Gate is surrounded by walls on three sides and the rushing River Chionthar to the south, making the city relatively secure from outside threats. For threats within the city, the Flaming Fist does its best to enforce law and order. However, the city's dense population and thriving economy have made it an ideal place for rogues and thieves to ply their trade. Facilitating such illicit activities is an extensive sewer system and network of subterranean structures. Such hidden passageways allow individuals to move throughout the city away from the prying eyes of more upstanding citizens and Flaming Fist patrols.",
						"Topside, a system of magically powered lanterns keep the city well-lit throughout the night. These lights are at their most dense near the city's major temples, around the Ducal Palace, and by the docks where they promote both safety and productivity in these areas.",
						"Buildings in the Gate generally get newer further away from the harbor, though exceptions are found where previous structures were torn down for more recent construction in the same lot. The typical style for buildings in the city is towards the tall and narrow, reflecting the fixed amount of area available for development within the walls. However, the Gate is not without urban decay, which is especially common in the Northeast Outskirts, largely considered the slums of the city where only the most destitute make their homes. The northwest represents the opposite side of this coin, containing most of the finer estates belonging to wealthy Baldurians.",
						"Like most aspects of life in Baldur's Gate, its balance of power largely revolves around what the city is mainly known for: commerce. The many trade organizations within the Gate have formed a symbiotic relationship with the Grand Dukes. The Dukes' approval means lucrative trade agreements, while strong trade organization support is often necessary for their election. Hired by the Dukes and paid through tariffs and taxes, the Flaming Fist mercenary company enforce the law\u2014while the city's highly organized and equally sizable Thieves' Guild works hard to ply their own trade without getting noticed.",
						"Baldur's Gate has had its fate entwined for more than a century with that of Bhaal, god of murder. Bhaal foresaw that he would die in the Time of Troubles and enacted a plan that would allow him to return to life. While that plan took more than a century to come to fruition, Bhaal has indeed been reborn in the city of Baldur's Gate. Having been dead for more than a century, he now works to rebuild his following and thus strengthen his divine might.",

								"Also known as the Council of Four, the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate rule the city and are entrusted with making political decisions to the benefit of its citizens. Each Duke is democratically elected by landowners within the Gate, serving for life or until resignation. Rarely, a Duke who has committed an egregious offense is then stripped of their title. Although anyone can theoretically become a Grand Duke with enough support, they are usually pulled from the ranks of wealthy merchants, renowned military leaders, and famous adventurers. The current Dukes consist of Ulder Ravengard (also commander of the Flaming Fist), Belynne Stelmane and Dillard Portyr. One of the positions has recently become open with the death of duke Thalamra Vanthampur. A newcomer to the city, {@creature Eo Ashmajiir|MaBJoV}, has been aggressively politicking to be elected to the empty seat.",
								"The first Dukes were directly linked to the port city's nautical past and were entirely made up of retired sea captains. Despite the importance of its port, Baldur's Gate was originally ruled by wealthy farmers. Sailors resented having to pay hefty fees and taxes to use the gates built by their lost colleague, Balduran. They eventually overthrew the farmers, installing the four oldest sea captains as rulers of the Gate. The four were originally called \"Grand Dukes\" in jest, but the title\u2014now used unironically\u2014has stuck to this day.",

One of the tallest buildings in Baldur's Gate, the Ducal Palace acts as an office for everyday decisions, a venue for regal ceremonies, and a suitably luxurious place to entertain politically important individuals visiting the city. The palace also provides sleeping quarters for temporarily displaced nobles and those whose main estates lie outside the city walls. As its name suggests, the Ducal Palace has been built to emulate the residences of more conventional royalty, complete with heavily fortified walls and high towers."

Another is their activity in Tethyr, an unstable nation currently embroiled in a long civil war. Some claim that agents of the Flaming Fist help to destabilize governments in Faerûn so that their services are always sought after.",

The elves of that ancient kingdom were saved from complete annihilation by the great elven hero Tethir\u2014the inspiration for the name of the forest. A seed given to the elves by their god, Rillifane Rallathil, was planted in the spot of Tethir's death to honor him.

In their version of the elven city it is always night. The city is as beautiful as its counterpart, except for a few places that have been twisted to reflect the inhabitants, such as the palace where Jon rules and the tower where Bodhi roosts. The former House of the Horn has become a lair for the Shadar-Kai, a twisted race of elves associated with the Raven Queen\u2014the dark ruler of the entire Shadowfell. Finally, the branches on the borders of the city are black and malformed, becoming the domain of bloodthirsty {@creature wolfwere|MaBJoV|wolfweres}. The branches grow thicker the further one travels, and only with the permission of either Jon or Bodhi will a path open up for someone to escape back into the real world.",
								"Jon and Bodhi lure travelers from across the Forest of Tethir into their cursed domain. They do this by opening pathways in the forest when the moon of Selune is at its fullest. These pathways seem to lead into supernaturally beautiful groves or echo with beautiful fey song. While most of those tricked into the shadow realm are younger elves from the city of Suldanessellar, there are members of almost every race trapped in the elven city's dark reflection.",
								"Those who first arrive find themselves in a place reminiscent to its real-world counterpart. Most of those trapped in the shadow city try to recreate a semblance of a normal life. The majority of the elven population distract themselves with music, dancing under the stars and praying to the Seldarine. For some elves, the despair of the place becomes too much and they either join the Shadar-Kai or wander out into the Black Branches ({@area S15|081}) to be torn apart by the {@creature wolfwere|MaBJoV|wolfweres}.",
								"Jon and Bodhi are always looking for those who can help free them from their prison. They have founded an organization called the Order of Icarus. Members of the Order are the only ones that the siblings allow to leave their realm. Members of the Order seek out magical secrets or capture learned sages or spell casters to bring back to their masters. Bodhi is the one who identifies those who might have the talents required to join the Order, selecting candidates from newly trapped travelers or children who have grown up in the Shadowfell and have just come of age.",
								"The inhabitants of the real world Suldanessellar have been tormented by its dark reflection for the entire century of its existence. When an elf in Suldanessellar goes into their daily trance, they can communicate with the elves trapped in Jon and Bodhi's realm. Those who have loved ones trapped in the shadow realm can become obsessed, spending all of their time conversing with them."

						"Ust Natha is a drow city located in the Middledark of the Underdark. Its location corresponds with the southwestern border of Amn and Tethyr on the surface world. The city is small, existing entirely within a single large cavern with most of its living areas built inside of hollowed out stalagmites. Despite its size, it has become a major trading hub between the drow and other races. The city also has historical significance for the drow, as legends claim that Ust Natha is located close to the surface caves where the Ilythiiri dark elves were forced to retreat after losing the fourth Crown war. After many generations, these Ilythiri refugees evolved into the modern day drow.",
						"Ust Natha must contend with several other Underdark settlements in the region, including a kuo-toa city and an illithid enclave. A nearby svirfneblin village is allowed to remain nominally independent as long as they supply a quota of slaves each year. The largest danger to Ust Natha is a recently awakened nest of {@creature phaerimm|MaBJoV}, located several miles beneath the city itself.",
						"The city is controlled by several competing drow houses, the most powerful of which is the Despana family. While a majority of the city's population are drow, in recent decades the city has allowed a large contingent of foreigners to take residence. This has been at the behest of Phaere Despana, who seeks to raise the fortunes of her house by creating a place within the Underdark where surface traders feel relatively safe. Organizations such as the Shadow Thieves and Zhentarim now have permanent trading establishments within the city. In addition to the drow population and surface traders, there are thousands of quaggoth and svirfneblin slaves that support the drow houses, and even a few illithid and aboleth envoys can be found within the city.",

The reason for this is that it is run by {@creature Farastu Stalker|mabjov|demodands} from the infernal plane of Carceri. A portal to the plane of Carceri is even located in its lower depths.

						"Sune is the goddess of beauty, also known as Lady Firehair and the Lady of Love. She represents not only physical beauty, but the beauty of music, fragrances and delicious foods. Her worshippers seek out the pleasure that comes from experiencing beauty in all its forms.",
						"The Church of Sune believes that all mortals deserve the opportunity to experience beauty during their brief lives. The church goes about ensuring that this opportunity exists in two manners. The first is the support of artistic endeavors. This covers a wide variety of ventures including culinary arts, music, painting, sculpting and others. Clerics of Sune seek out exceptional artistic talent and provide them with monetary grants or help them become members of prestigious organizations.",
						"The second focus of the church is much more pragmatic. The church uses its vast monetary resources to support civilization in all its forms; for without cities, towns and roads, there would not be theaters, restaurants, art galleries and all of the other venues that allow for the appreciation of beauty. The church pays for the construction of roads, forts and caravansaries so that travel between cities is less dangerous. They donate to military orders that defend civilization such as the Order of the Gauntlet and the Harpers. They work hard to make sure that the Lords' Alliance is well funded and try to smooth over squabbles between the city states that make up its membership. Because of this, there are more worshippers of Sune amongst the nobility of the Lords' Alliance than any other god or goddess.",
						"Temples to Sune often include venues for appreciating the arts or are built within a city district that includes them. A temple might include a vast public bathhouse with heated plumbing, or a multistory theater to allow for nightly plays or musical performances.",
