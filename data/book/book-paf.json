				"Adventures often begin in taverns. It's where parties meet, where travelers seek refuge, where bards sing and brawlers fight, where thieves make away with coin from an unsuspecting mark, and where rival wizards and warlocks break bread on neutral ground.",
				"On every continent, in every world, on every plane of existence, there is always a tavern\u2014or something very like one. One might wonder if taverns are more commonplace in Dungeons & Dragons than dungeons. Or dragons.",
				"While taverns are universal, they are not all the same. The infamous Yawning Portal in Waterdeep is the archetypal adventurer's tavern with its rowdy patrons, beer-soaked boards, and direct connection to possible quests via the giant well that leads right to the dangerous treasure-filled dungeons of the Undermountain! Other venues are distinctly different: the Driftwood Tavern is a historic public house, the Pink Flumph is a raucous downtown theater, the Halfway Inn is a lonely trading post on a long road, the Moonstone Mask is a genteel club, and the Hissing Stones is a restful thermal spa.",
				"In the following pages, you will encounter these places from all across the continent of Faerûn in the Forgotten Realms. You'll discover what sets each venue apart in terms of ambience, character, and clientele. You'll find recipes for popular, distinctive cocktails and appetizers that are the specialty of each house, and you'll learn a little something about the stories attached to those drinks and bites.",
				"An adventurer's tavern is not just mead and wine and salty songs. The drinks on offer can be as diverse, colorful, and strange as the members of your adventuring party.",

The first six chapters cover gin, whiskey, vodka, rum, tequila, and brandy. The subsequent chapters cover less ubiquitous spirits; wine-based drinks; beer, cider, and mead-based drinks; and alcohol-free drinks. Each chapter also includes a recipe for a shareable snack, something sweet or savory that pairs well with the drinks in that chapter and the atmosphere of that establishment.",

Rumors abound of their involvement in shady affairs, with talk of necromancy, vampirism, and tax avoidance. There is even scuttlebutt that the current Lord and Lady Cassalanter, Victorio and {@creature Ammalia Cassalanter|WDH|Ammalia}, sold their own young children's souls to a demonic entity and that their eldest child and heir, Osvaldo, is chained up in the depths of the netherworld.",

						"The city of Neverwinter has faced its share of power struggles over the years, but the city's history could have turned out very differently. Some of its gravest threats were quietly dealt with by a secretive guild of arcane mages known as the Many Starred Cloak who devote themselves to protecting the city. Rumor has it that one of their members from this forgotten organization was Lady Ophala, who established the Moonstone Mask to fund and support their operations. It's also said that a secret room exists at the establishment where members of the guild once met to make their plans. The name of the guild lives on in this sweet, spiced, delicious wine cocktail that remains popular throughout the blazing Neverwinter summer.",
						"The current owners of the Mask insist that if any secret meeting room ever existed, they have not found it; and if any such guild ever met there, they know nothing about it; and if the guild still exists and is still meeting there, they certainly will not answer questions about it, so perhaps you should order another drink.",

						"There were two silent monks who lived centuries ago at a temple near Baldur's Gate and they shared a loving bond of devotion as great as any offered to the gods. The story goes that when one of the pair lay on the threshold of death, the other gestured for the reaper to sit and take tea. The monk prepared a syrup of rosemary, the herb of remembrance. He brewed two cups of green tea and set them on the doorstep on a chilly morning to slowly steep and develop flavor. The monk used this time to cherish the last hours of his beloved friend's life and to set firm in his memory all that he loved about him. He and the reaper drank together in quiet contemplation, enjoying the sweetness of honey, the savor of rosemary, and the vivacity of green tea. This drink is now served at the Hissing Stones and always enjoyed in silent remembrance.",

						"The Hissing Stones offers a range of relaxation and restoration techniques from various traditions across the continents, from meditation to mud baths. One technique that seems to arise in almost all cultures is enjoying a quiet cup of tea and some cookies.",
						"The legendary kenku monk Whey-Shu brought the recipe for these cookies to Baldur's Gate. Raised in a monastery after goblins destroyed her flock, Whey-Shu devoted her life to the {@class Monk|PHB|Way of the Shadow|Shadow|PHB}, finding strength in silence and power in subtle action. These tearoom cookies are appropriately delicate in texture and flavor. They do not overwhelm the senses.",
