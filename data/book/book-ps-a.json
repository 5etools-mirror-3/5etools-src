						"This whole Plane Shift thing started because of Zendikar. It's hard to imagine a Magic plane better suited for D&D adventuring than the one that was conceived, from start to finish, as \"adventure world.\" Making the transition from {@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering\u2014Zendikar} to {@i Plane Shift: Zendikar} was thus perfectly natural.",
						"Innistrad came next, bolstered by the happy coincidence of the {@adventure Curse of Strahd|CoS} adventure coming out close to the same time. Then with {@i Plane Shift: Kaladesh}, I got to stray a little further from the core D&D experience, presenting a fairly fast and loose take on reskinning D&D magic items into the aether-powered inventions of Kaladesh. And now we come to Amonkhet\u2014a desert plane inspired by ancient Egypt, ruled by an evil dragon Planeswalker, and which features one small safe haven from an undead infestation. It is not a traditional D&D setting.",
						"The trials of the five gods provide the most obvious structure for a campaign set on Amonkhet. A group of initiates from the same crop might go through the trials together, and those trials alone could form the entirety of a short campaign. To flesh out the experience, characters could also undertake missions on the behalf of gods or viziers: defending the Hekma, joining the gods on a hunting expedition in the desert, and so on. The campaign could get complicated with the addition of viziers, who normally do not go through the trials (unless they choose to), or if any or all of the characters become dissenters.",
						"Perhaps the best way to think of an Amonkhet campaign is that it takes place against the backdrop of the five trials, rather than being all about the trials. The trials provide a structure and a sense of drama, but relationships among characters\u2014and between characters and the rest of the world\u2014are where the meat of the story unfolds. You could set your campaign in the period leading up to when initiate player characters undergo one of the trials, with the trial as a climax to the whole story. You could use the Trial of Solidarity and the Trial of Ambition as a framing device for the campaign, to explore issues of collective unity versus personal achievement. (Initiate characters would undergo the Trials of Knowledge and Strength on their own terms.) Or you could ignore the trials entirely and focus on dissenter characters trying to upset the social order of Naktamun.",
						"As always, {@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering\u2014Amonkhet} is the definitive resource for information about the plane. With this document, you can use that information to build a campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules, which you can {@link find here|https://dnd.wizards.com/what-is-dnd/basic-rules}. And even without the book, you can find lore about Amonkhet on {@link the Magic web site|https://magic.wizards.com/}.",

Awe-inspiring, animal-headed gods walk among the people, offering them care and protection from the horrors of the desert. A wide, life-giving river offers its abundant bounty, providing for every physical need. Happy, hopeful people offer sacrifices in grand temples dedicated to their benevolent gods, addressing their spiritual needs. For they know that this life, as wonderful as it might be, is just the beginning\u2014a prelude to the perfection that awaits them in the afterlife, promised to them by their God-Pharaoh.",

Accursed, desiccated mummies roam that desert, while carefully embalmed mummies attend to the needs of the living in the glorious city-state. The people have everything they need. They are protected from the desert heat and wandering mummies by the magical barrier called the Hekma, and they spend their lives in focused training, honing body and mind to perfection. Yet they eagerly anticipate the time when they will be permitted to die in combat and leave this world behind.",
				"On the surface, Amonkhet seems like a marvelous place to live. But something unsettling and nefarious lurks behind the grand facade. The wise and benevolent God-Pharaoh, said to be busy preparing the wondrous afterlife for the worthy, is actually Nicol Bolas\u2014the malevolent dragon Planeswalker whose schemes reach far beyond this plane. And all the preparation and training, all the trials and contests, all the effort to be made worthy\u2014all of this is meant to prepare the people of Amonkhet for transformation into an undead army under Bolas's command.",

								"Unknown to any of the plane's inhabitants, the entire society of Amonkhet has been manipulated by Nicol Bolas, who has seized control of the world, the gods, and the magic of the plane. Bolas chose this plane for his schemes because of the presence of a magical substance called lazotep, which interacts with the magic of necromancy in strange and powerful ways. Conveniently, he also found here a pious, structured civilization that he could easily subvert to his own purposes. Making himself the God-Pharaoh, he brought the gods themselves under his control, and eliminated anyone who tried to stand against him. Then he transformed the world into a factory designed to produce a huge army of perfect undead soldiers\u2014mummies embalmed in lazotep.",
								"Adapting the peculiar magic of the plane, Bolas found a means to preserve the combat skills of the living after death. He has selected five aspects of character that he desires most in his undead soldiers, and has built the society of Amonkhet around a series of trials designed to hone and perfect those aspects of body and mind. Throughout their lives, the people of the plane believe they are drawing nearer to the promised afterlife\u2014and at last they die in the final trial, a mass battle with no survivors. But rather than earning a place in the afterlife, they are instead embalmed in lazotep and stored in Bolas's great necropolis, adding to the ranks of his undead army."

								"Part of the magic of Amonkhet that Bolas has been able to exploit is a necromantic phenomenon called the Curse of Wandering. This naturally occurring magic causes any being who dies on the plane to rise again after a short time, cursed with insatiable hunger and an irresistible drive to attack the living. Desiccated mummies created by the Curse of Wandering fill the desert wasteland that dominates the plane, constantly threatening what little life remains. But the people of Amonkhet do not fear the threat of attack as much as they dread the knowledge that all who live will one day die and fall under the same curse. Death under the effect of the Curse of Wandering is a terrifying afterlife filled with endless suffering.",
								"What God-Pharaoh Nicol Bolas offers to the people of Amonkhet is an alternative to an eternity of wandering: an afterlife of glorious delights. And all they need to do to attain this eternal bliss is prove that they are worthy. As such, the threat of the Curse of Wandering is a strong motivation for people to undergo the trials of devotion that the God-Pharaoh demands."

				"This is the fourth {@i Plane Shift} article (corresponding to the release of the fourth volume of {@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering}), which means that at this point, you could put together a four-person party of Planeswalkers and have each one of them come from a different plane.",
				"Fundamentally, no game rules are attached to being a Planeswalker. Traveling from plane to plane in this sort of campaign is a lot like overland travel in a normal campaign: it's about getting to where the adventure is. It's a story function, not a rules one. If planeswalking is part of the campaign, then everyone in the party has to be able to do it, so they can travel together. (In modern Magic, there's no way to bring another living person along with you when you planeswalk.) That means there's not really any question of game balance where planeswalking is concerned\u2014it doesn't make one character more powerful than another, and it doesn't make characters any stronger against the enemies they're fighting. So it's something that can be added on to any other character, without changing the character's class, race, or background.",
				"How does planeswalking work? Well, despite the name of this article series, it actually doesn't bear much resemblance to the {@spell plane shift} spell. When characters planeswalk, it usually takes prolonged focus to bring two worlds together and create the bridge to cross between them. This process takes about a minute and is similar to casting a ritual, so it's not generally something that Planeswalkers can do to escape combat. It also doesn't allow for much precision. As a rule, the point on a plane where a Planeswalker arrives is up to the DM, and it's usually the same location for each visit a character makes to a plane.",
				"Occasionally in Magic fiction, characters do planeswalk in the middle of combat, usually when something dire is about to happen. (That includes the circumstances when a character's Planeswalker spark first ignites.) To model that, at the DM's discretion, a Planeswalker who is about to drop to 0 hit points can make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the character instead takes no damage and planeswalks away. It's up to the DM what plane the character ends up on, because this isn't usually an intentional process.",
				"You could do a lot of adventuring on just the four planes detailed in the art books and {@i Plane Shift} articles so far. But if you want to take your Planeswalker characters to Theros, Tarkir, Ravnica, Dominaria, Mirrodin, Alara, Fiora, Lorwyn, Kamigawa, or any other plane in the Magic Multiverse, you can follow the example of what I've been doing in these articles. Reskin and tweak existing monsters, and inject a healthy dose of creativity and improvisation as you go. Some of those worlds are full of creatures that could have stepped right out of the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, while others will present a greater challenge.",
				"The most important thing is that a campaign involving Planeswalkers requires an agreement between the players and the DM. Even more than usual, if the players decide to ignore the plot hooks set before them and go off anywhere in the Multiverse just because they can, they can make the DM's job more taxing than fun. It's one thing to have a Planeswalker pop off to Ravnica for an hour to buy a cup of coffee, but it's quite another for the players to decide that they want to take on the corruption of New Phyrexia today, instead of following clues that lead clearly to an Innistrad campaign.",
				"Speaking of New Phyrexia, a campaign with Planeswalkers is generally more fun with higher-level characters. The Planeswalkers who feature in the stories of Magic are powerful mages of various kinds, and their actions can sometimes decide the fate of whole planes. It doesn't always need to be like that, of course, but it can be hard to motivate characters with the ability to travel literally anywhere to stick around and root out a nest of {@creature giant rat|MM|giant rats}.",
				"So can Planeswalker characters travel from Amonkhet to whatever plane the Forgotten Realms lies on? That's up to you. The {@i Plane Shift} series more or less assumes a certain continuity from one Multiverse to the next, even as (for example) it makes no attempt to model Magic's five colors of mana in the D&D magic system. So there's no real reason an elf from Evereska couldn't \"spark out\" and find herself on Kaladesh, as long as it works for your players and your campaign.",
