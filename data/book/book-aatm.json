				"The Mortuary rises above Sigil, the crossroads of the multiverse, like a dead hand erupting from a grave. Headquarters of the Heralds of Dust, one of the oldest philosophical factions in the City of Doors, the Mortuary is a house of death: a morgue, funeral home, and tomb of immense scale linked to burial sites on other planes and worlds. The Mortuary is located in the Hive Ward, the seediest of Sigil's districts. In the Mortuary's eerie yet reverent chambers, the Heralds of Dust receive, process, and lay the dead to rest on a multiversal scale, ensuring every creature that dies in Sigil earns its obsequies.",
				"Managing the dead is grueling and thankless work, but without the Mortuary and its grim workforce\u2014many of whom are Undead\u2014there would be no room in Sigil left for the living; bodies would pile in the streets, the stench of rotting corpses would fill the air, and restless souls with nowhere to go would plague citizens in droves.",

								"{@creature Factol Skall|AATM|Skall} is the current factol of the Heralds of Dust and the only leader the faction has ever had. A popular Duster legend holds that other than the Lady of Pain herself, Skall is Sigil's oldest resident, the first creature to live and die in the City of Doors. The Heralds of Dust idolize their ageless factol, whose stoic visage has become the faction's emblem. Skall can usually be found examining his {@area orrery of souls|025|x} (detailed earlier in this supplement).",
								"After eons of existence, Skall is in an advanced state of deterioration. Once a spry lich with a wrinkled frame, he now drifts listlessly through the Mortuary's forlorn halls, rasping to himself. Skall appears as little more than a floating, disembodied head and two hands, his tattered cloak fluttering behind them. Notorious among the factols of Sigil but rarely seen in the flesh, Skall often delegates his bureaucratic responsibilities to Undead proxies or\u2014on rare occasions\u2014appears as an illusory duplicate. Subtle social cues are lost on the factol, whose eternal nature has eroded any memory of mortal life.",
								"As a result of his decay, Skall's power has waned considerably, but challenging him in combat is as much a death sentence as ever. Factol Skall imparts a lasting oblivion to his enemies. Caretaker, custodian, and grave keeper, the factol ushers allies and foes alike from this false existence toward the path to True Death."

Though most Duster exorcists conduct their operations in the Mortuary, many heed calls throughout Sigil and the planes beyond.",
								"The vagaries of undeath make spirits difficult to predict. Nevertheless, exorcists are well equipped for their work. Molded by experiences with apparitions and their ilk, exorcists channel the forces of death to preserve the living, commune with the dead, and drive evil spirits back to their graves. They can also fire versatile bolts of necrotic or radiant energy from their staves to repel a host of supernatural entities.",

To do this, they seek servants to exact their will, coercing even the most stubborn potential minions by turning their own blood against them.",

Unable to extinguish their horrific unlife, virtuous faiths and vigilant organizations (like the {@book Order of the Guardians|VRGR|3|Order of the Guardians} detailed in {@book Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft|VRGR}) seal these viscous horrors in magically warded prisons. As ages pass, though, the knowledge of what these prisons contain and where some lie have been lost. And every imprisoned necrichor understands that its captivity might be lengthy, but time is of little consequence to the ageless. Necrichors that escape their imprisonment have the statistics presented here."

Those from the Lower Planes might appear as roiling waves of fiendish flames or other sinister forms, while those from the Upper Planes often appear as blooms of light and wild growth or similarly majestic shapes. On the rare occasions that planar incarnates appear on another plane, they might take either form or appear as unique manifestations of the philosophies they embody."
