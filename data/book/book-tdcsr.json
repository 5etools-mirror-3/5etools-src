Five adventurers on the deck of the airship face the adranach and rush to attack it, with a sixth adventurer leaping to attack the adranach. The adranach is a large, purple, luminescent winged creature with a silver mask, silver-taloned front paws, and stars glittering in its wings.",

						"Inspiration can come from anywhere: a musician's song, the advice of a close friend, or just the trust that another being places in you. In my experience, few things can compare to the surge of joy and motivation that being inspired gives.",
						"I have often found inspiration in fantasy worlds and books of adventure, mystery, and magic. I grew up devouring every novel I was handed, seeking to lose myself in the words of another mind, channeling the images they evoked in my mind into my sketchbook. But it wasn't until I discovered tabletop roleplaying games that I felt truly empowered to create my own worlds, places like the ones that I so often found myself lost in. Even better, it let me share all the ideas in my head with my friends, and they could do the same with me. I was spellbound.",
						"It's been about twenty-five years since my first game. Since then, I've drawn endless inspiration from the imaginations of my friends and loved ones as we tell heroic stories around a table with dice and paper. I've found a circle of friends who share my love of dramatic storytelling, my belief that failure in games is just as exciting as success (maybe even more so), and my delight in being inspired by moments of improvisational brilliance. It's still surreal that we found a way to share that with the world; {@i Critical Role} has become a phenomenon that's surpassed my wildest dreams. Over the past few years, we've built the magical world of Exandria together, warts and all, and somehow it's become a world that millions of others have engaged with and invested their imaginations in. I hope it's inspired you to create your own adventures, stories, and joyful memories. Through Vox Machina's epic tale, the land of Tal'Dorei became a landscape rife with intrigue, conflict, and endless possibility... and we wanted to share it with you.",
						"Years ago, I had an opportunity to bring Tal'Dorei to the page and invite the world to tell their own stories in Exandria. The thrill of the opportunity was incredible, but the immense pressure and fear of failure (given my absolute lack of experience doing something like this) made it a strenuous journey on an incredibly short timeline. I was incredibly blessed to have become friends with the immeasurably brilliant James Haeck around that time, and I asked him to join me in this task. My good fortune found him agreeing, and with his help and inspiration, it somehow came together. With that, a limited run of the {@i Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting} went into the world.",
						"Time has passed, both in our world and within the world of Exandria. Vox Machina's greatest adventures came to a close. Looking two decades later (within Exandria), we embarked on a new adventure with the Mighty Nein in the land of Wildemount...but Vox Machina and Tal'Dorei remained deeply dear to my heart. The question arose: what would Tal'Dorei look like these two decades later? What changes would have taken place in the recovery following the Chroma Conclave and the ascension of the Whispered One? How would the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have adjusted to life after the end of their story? What dangers and threats, both old and new, would the next generation of heroes need to rise up against?",
						"Inspiration struck once more, and now that {@i Critical Role} had the means to do so...we needed to answer these questions for both ourselves and the numerous Critters who often conjectured as we did. \"{@book Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}\" Well, we can finally answer that! I immediately called James Haeck back to the fray, and we were joined this time by the extraordinary mind and talents of Hannah Rose to elevate these ideas into something better than I could have hoped. Between us, Tal'Dorei was Reborn. We invite you to get lost in this world, learn of its intricacies and secrets, and, I hope, be inspired to make this world yours as well.",

The world of Exandria is home to four major continents, dozens of nations, and untold tiny pockets of civilization amid a wondrous, dangerous wilderness. Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.",

Vasselheim became Exandria's oldest surviving city by virtue of not just being built long ago, but by enduring the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} (which shall be elucidated presently), a miraculous feat that few other charted settlements can claim to have accomplished.",

										"Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fire, seething oceans, and churning, gnashing rock. Through the ashen skies of Primordial Creation, the gods arrived from an unknown realm located beyond the ether. These ambitious divinities\u2014young and still formless\u2014looked down upon this roiling realm and saw potential for great strength and outstanding beauty, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.",
										"From the divine hands of the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} sprung forth the First Children, the {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}. It is thought that they were made in their creator's image, yet it is just as likely that the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}, and all the gods who shared their ideas with them, actually adopted forms inspired by the image of their creations. The First Children walked the lush Green and gazed upon the heavenly Blue as the gods tamed Primordial Creation around them.",
										"Not long after, in the scale of the cosmos, a second mortal creation was wrought by the divine {@deity The All-Hammer|Exandria|TDCSR|All-Hammer}: the {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves}, a hearty people imbued with the desire to continue the gods' work\u2014taming a primordial world filled with the craft and invention of the divinity that lay beyond the ashen void. In their turn, a third people were given life by the passionate lovers of Order and Chaos, the {@deity The Lawbearer|Exandria|TDCSR|Lawbearer} and the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}.

										"As a note from the High Curator of {@book Emon's|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} Cobalt Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of Exandria began to worship them\u2014yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of the people.",
										"As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other creations followed, giving life to Exandria's many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear, for while the {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}, {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves}, and {@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans} were undeniably Exandria's first races, the identities of the many Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City's chroniclers.",
										"These myriad young races explored their freshly founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world around them.",
										"This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic, and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good\u2014but fragile, and in need of guardians.",
										"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Tal'Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization's reach stretched across the world. The people praised the gods for their newfound safety, and their prayers gave them forms, names, and purpose."

The gods watched as their children were crushed between gnashing rocks and fed to formless terrors unleashed in the wake of the destruction.

Rather than universal goodwill and comfort for all, the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum} came to be defined by endless petty squabbles over wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for their scraps. Tantalizing rumors of a path to immortality slithered through the most decadent circles of magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name lost and presumed to be struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making of her the first and only living mortal to ascend.

The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos, a byproduct of the gods' Creation, was twisted into a place of evil.

The most fertile soil of all for these noxious seeds lay in mortal hearts obsessed with the infinite power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} soon made their presence known to the world with a surprise assault on Vasselheim itself.",
										"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of their protectors, the metallic dragons, and even a number of the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} themselves.

Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}, who could be true allies? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, what value did mortal lives hold?

It was the hardy, dependable {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves} who best weathered the war between gods and mortals, beneath the {@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|3|Cliffkeep Mountains}. Dozens of dwarven redoubts rose and fell in the tumult of the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} and the uncertain era that followed it. For many years, {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves} lived in the tunnels beneath the {@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|3|Cliffkeep Mountains}, leaderless and chaotic, until the various clans unified to form the subterranean city of {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer}. Proud of their grand new home, the dwarf clans were content to remain beneath the earth. They saw the war-scarred surface world as a source of naught but misery and death, and their new underground domain as a place of undiscovered prosperity. This city was dug underneath the mountains, and its deep roots, though young, survived where more ancient ancestral halls were annihilated. Clan Jaggenstrike were the architects of {@book Kraghammer's|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} hardy, unassailable redoubts, and easily became the first ruling clan of the {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves}.",

They returned at the turning of the ages under the guidance of an elven sorceress named Yenlara Alderwreath.",

Nearly three centuries of Tal'Dorei rule in the realm ended under the rule of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, his life cut short when much of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} was reduced to rubble.",
										"The attack not only killed the Sovereign Uriel, but also scattered the {@book Council of Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}, throwing the realm into chaos.

										"The {@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|3|5. Alabaster Lyceum} need hardly introduce the heroes of this story.

After many adventures, these heroes gathered their allies and stormed the capital of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, slaying {@book Thordak the Cinder King|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King} and freeing its people. Upon discovering the machinations of the real mastermind, Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, with whom Vox Machina had held a tenuous alliance, they gave chase and finally slew this last standing member of the Chroma Conclave, ending their reign over the land and restoring rule once more to the {@book Council of Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}.",

								"When the new reign of Tal'Dorei was established three centuries ago, {@book Zan Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant} deposed a brutal tyrant. Though she was beloved by the people, she did not wish to be given unchecked or un-counseled rule over the realm. Nevertheless, her inner circle obeyed the will of the people and crowned her Sovereign of Tal'Dorei. She took to her new role well and swiftly expanded her council by appointing some of her trusted allies\u2014and even some dissenting voices\u2014to form an assembly of scholars, generals, and philosophers to govern at her side. This {@book Council of Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council} worked alongside their sovereign to rebuild the realm following the end of {@book Drassig's|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig} line, and were instrumental in the following prosperity of the nascent Tal'Dorei Empire.",
								"Twenty-six years ago, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, the latest and last of the Tal'Dorei line, publicly ended the monarchy and passed power over to the council, formally divesting his line of power. Tragically, this ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of the four ancient dragons known as the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}. The dragons destroyed the city of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, and the man who had until moments ago been sovereign was one of the first casualties. Uriel Tal'Dorei is survived by his wife Salda, and three children\u2014{@book Odessa|TDCSR|2|Seeker Odessa Tal'Dorei}, Illiya, and Gren\u2014who have used their family's still considerable wealth and power to become well-known public figures in {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}. {@book Odessa|TDCSR|2|Seeker Odessa Tal'Dorei} herself won a seat on the council in a landslide victory.",
								"In the generation since the fall of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, the council has risen to the challenge of rebuilding and governing their new republic. This state's power is highly decentralized; each individual city-state in Tal'Dorei largely acts according to its own interests, with the council in place to ensure that pursuing those interests benefits the common good. Some critics of the republic say that the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council} is little more than a glorified city council for {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, though it is just as often praised for governing lightly as a rule, and for using the spy network helmed by the council's Master of Law to root out corruption as needed.",
								"In addition to the historical Six Masters whose positions have existed on the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council} since Zan's time, a variable number of delegates also cast votes in matters of state. Each settlement in Tal'Dorei whose population numbers at least five thousand is offered the option to elect delegates to the council if they wish to engage in national politics. The settlement is permitted one delegate per five thousand people, and the means of their election is left to the settlement's local government. Additionally, any settlement with a population of over twenty thousand can appoint an ambassador to {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}; these ambassadors also sit on the council and have voting power. Once in {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, each township's delegation is expected to negotiate with one another and find agreement. If an accord can't be reached, they must go through the slow process of drafting proposals to be voted on by seated members of the council.",
								"Though {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} and {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn} remain sovereign city-states, the invasion of the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave} convinced lawmakers that even tighter alliances between the peoples of Tal'Dorei were necessary. One ambassador each from both {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} and {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn} now also holds a seat with voting power on the council.

The skyswimmers and their {@creature wyvern|MM} {@quickref Mounts and Vehicles|PHB|1|0|mounts} seize the strands of light on their spears and paint radiant, esoteric portraits in the wintry sky, drawing intrepid outsiders from across Tal'Dorei to camp on remote mountains and marvel at their visual poetry.",

And though many of these races appear monolithic at first glance, all are incredibly varied. A first-time visitor to Tal'Dorei might initially perceive all {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves} as haughty and fascinated with heritage, because that's the dominant culture in {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn}, the largest elf-majority city on the continent. However, the {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves} living in villages and cities across the land are often exceptions to that apparent rule, and it's dangerous\u2014not to mention rude\u2014for travelers to assume that any of Tal'Dorei's varied peoples fit into simple boxes.",

								"For generations of roleplaying gamers in many different RPG campaign settings, certain of the fantasy peoples in the world of Exandria have long been considered \"monsters\" or \"evil races.\" {@book Goblins|TDCSR|4|goblinkin}, {@book orcs|TDCSR|4|orcs}, and {@book bugbears|TDCSR|4|goblinkin} are examples of peoples whose very nature was supposedly tainted by inherent evil, and were thus morally unambiguous targets for adventurers to kill and loot. This mindset treats these people as no different from monsters like {@creature basilisk|MM|basilisks} or {@creature giant spider|MM|giant spiders}.",
								"The humanoid people of Tal'Dorei aren't set up that way. Any creature with the humanoid type is a thinking, feeling person. Creatures with the dragon, giant, or fey type are also unambiguously sapient, and thus can have any alignment. It's just as likely for a human to be a neutral evil {@creature bandit} as it is for an orc to be a chaotic good {@creature swashbuckler|VGM}, or for a {@creature hobgoblin} to be a lawful good {@creature knight}. And if you like, you can take this even further in your games and say that any fantasy creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher is capable of free thought, and should have just as wide a range of alignments as other sapient beings.",
								"The stories in {@i Critical Role} are filled with shades of moral gray, but Tal'Dorei still has plenty of unambiguously evil creatures. Most demons, devils, and undead are suffused with cosmic evil, and always try to subvert righteousness. Likewise, unthinking creatures such as oozes and constructs, and creatures of instinctual intelligence such as beasts, many monstrosities, and plant creatures, all make morally unambiguous foes.",

Cultists of evil gods, including the {@book Remnants|TDCSR|2|The Remnants} who worship {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}, and merciless, blood-soaked bandits such as the {@book Ravagers|TDCSR|4|Ravagers} are clear and immediate threats to both the safety of the player characters and all free peoples of Tal'Dorei. Depending on the tone of your story, the characters might cut such foes down without mercy\u2014or they might try to rehabilitate them.

However, the more recent past has instilled in people the need to break down old barriers, work together, and live together.",

A dwarf raised in {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} and a dwarf raised in {@book Stilben|TDCSR|3|Stilben} are likely to have very different attitudes about family, food, faith, and all the other factors that make up a culture.",

								"The dragonblood of Exandria are a people of unknown origin, and countless myths surround their ancestral creation.

Their spread across the world was hastened by the assault against the free peoples of Exandria by the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}. During that conflict, the ancient white dragon known as Vorugal the Frigid Doom destroyed the magical city-state of Draconia, the ancestral homeland of most dragonblood.",

Dragonblood of Exandria can either be born with a tail or without. In Draconia, those with tails were called draconians or draconbloods, for they were seen as closer in form and power to true dragons. Those without tails were given the name of ravenites and enslaved. Their blood and toil built the mighty towers of Draconia, yet the ravenites enjoyed none of their city's splendor.",
								"The ruin of Draconia thus marked the start of an era of freedom and self-determination for the ravenites. In Tal'Dorei, it's apparent that any differences between the ravenites and the draconians have nothing to do with bloodline or draconic power. Those differences are cultural, and rooted in a past whose conflicts still haven't been resolved. The oppression that existed in Draconia remains largely unknown within Tal'Dorei to this day, and outside of major cities such as {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, dragonblood can go for months, even years, without seeing another of their kind.",

Powerful archmages wove the overflowing arcane powers of the war into legendary magic items that could both thwart death and mete it out in equal measure.",

Soon after, the war climaxed in a wave of total destruction that left much of Exandria in ruins. Thousands of years of history were reduced to ash\u2014and in that ash were buried many of these selfsame relics. Some of those not lost were passed down through bloodlines for generations, becoming potent symbols of authority and rulership. Others were sealed away by those who feared their power.

The base state of a Vestige of Divergence is its dormant state, which the item returns to if sealed away or otherwise kept from being attuned by a worthy individual for a long period of time. A dormant state still imbues a modicum of power to an attuned wielder. But with time, perseverance, and personal growth, the Vestige of Divergence can regain access to some of its lost power in its awakened state. Eventually, if its bearer overcomes personal hardship and transforms their own soul, a Vestige of Divergence reaches its full potential in its exalted state.

Still others might be in the hands of twisted souls using them to terrorize the weak and defenseless.

								"The {@creature lizardfolk} of Tal'Dorei emerged from the {@book K'Tawl Swamp|TDCSR|3|K'Tawl Swamp} in the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}. Mages from an unnamed flying city descended into the swamp and conducted intense magical experiments on the local fauna. Some mutated into {@creature giant lizard|MM|giant lizards}, others into slithering swamp serpents\u2014and others into humanoid beings. The mages took a few of these {@creature lizardfolk} as specimens, and left the other fruits of their experiments behind.",
								"In time, these abandoned {@creature lizardfolk} used their cunning minds and skilled hands to create tools. They called themselves the Kuul'tevir\u2014noble masters of the earth and water. These folk advanced rapidly, and though they never matched the heights of the flying cities of the magi who created them, they built magnificent domains filled with towering spires and glimmering magical waterfalls.",
								"When the decadence of the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum} gave way to the chaos of the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, the Kuul'tevir delved deep into corrupting magic to save their grandeur. For a time, their people prospered, bolstered by the magic of demons and evil gods. But in the end, the desire to survive at any cost turned the Kuul'tevir's rulers against one another. Cabals of petty warlocks tore the {@creature lizardfolk|MM|lizardfolk's} magnificent societies apart, and the evil magic they wielded began to devour even the magic that the ancient mages had used to turn them from simple reptiles into a majestic people.",
								"Today, the majesty of the Kuul'tevir is little more than distant myth. Most {@creature lizardfolk} live in small communities in swamps, jungles, and fiery mountains across Tal'Dorei. Some live in cities, especially those with hot, humid climates, but no {@creature lizardfolk} today possess the supernatural poise and power that they did in the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}. Today, the {@creature lizardfolk} are a people like any other\u2014just trying to survive in modest comfort. But many still cling to the mythic memory of their ancient civilization and have allied themselves with terrible tyrants such as {@book Thordak the Cinder King|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King} in an attempt to resurrect their lost glory.",
