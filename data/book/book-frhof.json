Karlach, one of the heroes of {@i Baldur's Gate 3}, has a magical {@i Infernal Engine} for a heart, which grants her incredible power but brings unusual, life-threatening complications.

For example, a merchant who gives daily obeisance to Waukeen, the god of trade, might offer up a propitiatory prayer to Umberlee, god of the sea, when faced with a long and difficult voyage.",

Are you\u2014or do you aspire to become\u2014one of your god's Chosen?",

For example, a character that reveres Chauntea or Mielikki might despise Malar, a god of the hunt, or Auril, a god of winter, both of which represent nature in an evil, destructive form. Or you might carry a special enmity toward one of Malar's Chosen.",

Even if you're making a character that doesn't cast spells, magic might have affected your character's life, their family, or their occupation.

Ruins of ancient, forgotten realms dot the landscape, and these ruins often conceal expansive subterranean dungeons that wind beneath the surface. In these places, long-lost treasures await intrepid adventurers.",

Its meaning has since expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, such as the magic keeping the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril afloat, the wards of Silverymoon, and the smaller workings of magic that keep safe important locations like Candlekeep. Some even consider the many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain beneath Waterdeep a mythal.",

Evereska's mythal influences the area's weather and wards its inhabitants against disease, while the mythal of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable and more comfortable for creatures not suited to underwater life.",

Mythals can sometimes heal themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra's most recent return.",

								"Adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or failing mythals in ruined locations where magic once had great influence. Although an {@spell Identify|XPHB} spell might reveal some of a mythal's simplest effects, spellcasters can discover spellcasting restrictions only by trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal without assistance, but such feats are rarely attempted by even the most renowned mages. Any elven city with \"Myth\" in its name (Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has or had a mythal.

Inspired by what he witnessed, Eldenser called other amethyst dragons to Cormyr and persuaded them to partner with the kingdom's Purple Dragon Knights to defend Cormyr while pursuing new knowledge and experiences. Now the knights ride amethyst dragons across Faerûn to oppose Cormyr's enemies, hunt aberrant monsters, and carry out the will of Cormyr's noble queen, Raedra.",
