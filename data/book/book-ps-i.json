Abandoned by their angels and hunted by vampires, all the Stensians can do is endure the unending dusk."

And at the same time, humanity's age-old enemies grow ever more dangerous.",

Werewolves are a living embodiment of the secret rage and violence that hide in the human heart. Vampires are the bodily manifestation of carnal desire, hedonistic cravings, and bloodlust. Zombies and geists\u2014the restless spirits of the dead\u2014paint the eventual future of all people in the starkest terms, underlining the grim truths of human mortality. Demons are the unholy inversion of humanity's spiritual longings\u2014the shadow side of the angels' brightness.",

These are the humans that have been consumed by Innistrad's darkness. Sinister cultists give themselves over to demons and other dark forces. Depraved necromancers raise the dead to do their bidding. Obsessive scholars pry into secrets best left hidden. Crazed scientists toy with forces of life and death in their effort to create artificial life or harness the energy that remains in the spirits of the dead. And even among the common folk\u2014on Innistrad as on every plane\u2014some simply give in to selfish desires and violent rage, killing with knife and garrote rather than sorcery."

Without warning, the searing fury of the archangel\u2014usually reserved for the greatest foes of humanity\u2014was turned on villages full of seemingly innocent people. Angels under Avacyn's leadership impaled the innocent on their spears and scoured the earth with celestial fire.

Here and there, renegade cathars disobeyed the mandate of the church and continued to hunt vampires and werewolves instead of punishing the innocent.

						"{@class Sorcerer||Sorcerers} are rare. A spearsage (one of the archmages of Goldnight) could be a sorcerer, especially if you use the favored soul variant presented in Unearthed {@skill Arcana}. A sorcerer might also be a necro-alchemist or a cultist of some sort.",
						"{@class Warlock||Warlocks} are found primarily in cults of madness (with a Great Old One as patron), demon cults such as the Skirsdag, or witches' covens. A warlock who belongs to the Skirsdag might be a respected member of the church hierarchy, feigning the blessings of Avacynian clergy.",

Rather than unleashing hordes of spawn upon the world as the Eldrazi did on Zendikar, Emrakul causes the living creatures of Innistrad to transform into her spawn, becoming warped and horrible fusions of normal and Eldrazi flesh.
