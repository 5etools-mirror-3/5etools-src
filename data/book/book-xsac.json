												"Rules are a big part of what makes D&D a game, rather than simply improvised storytelling. The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.",
												"The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unwieldy. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we took for fifth edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we celebrate the DM as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.",
												"In a typical D&D session, a DM makes numerous rules decisions\u2014some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn't clear or when one rule seems to contradict another.",
												"Dealing with those situations is where Sage Advice comes in. It doesn't replace a DM's adjudication. Just as the rules do, this FAQ is meant to give DMs, as well as players, tools for tuning the game according to their tastes.",
