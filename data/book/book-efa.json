						"The language of the Draconic Prophecy is richly symbolic and largely conditional. Rather than laying out a predetermined series of events, it explores causation and consequences\u2014it describes what might happen in one arena of existence if something changes in another.",
						"Scholars sometimes approach the Draconic Prophecy as a puzzle, where solving it is its own reward. They look at each individual fragment of the Prophecy as a self-contained challenge, and they explore how a certain series of actions might fulfill the Prophecy.",
						"The immortal beings who are truly invested in the Prophecy, however\u2014primarily the dragons of the Chamber and the fiendish Lords of Dust\u2014view each fragment as a tiny piece of a much larger whole. From this broader perspective, one fragment or verse cascades into another, acting out a drama that unfolds over decades, centuries, or even millennia. Every verse will be fulfilled in time, these immortals believe, and their goal is simply to tilt the direction of destiny to one side or another.",
						"The verse of the Prophecy that begins this introduction is typical, in that each line is open to multiple interpretations. Consider these possibilities:",
						"{@b \"The gorgon's breath.\"} These words could refer to a literal {@creature gorgon|XMM}, perhaps one magically altered or infused with radiant energy so its breath restores health, brings the dead back to life, or animates objects. Or they could refer to {@area House Cannith|1d7|x}, whose symbol is a gorgon. (Members of the Chamber, in particular, believe that mortals' dragonmarks appeared on flesh in order to involve these people in the story of the Prophecy.) The words could refer to Cannith artificers \"breathing life\" into their warforged creations.",
						"{@b \"When fires create.\"} These words could easily refer to the fires of a smith's forge, especially when connected to House Cannith as the gorgon in the previous line. Or they could refer to the birth of a new thing from the ashes of the old, or to mortal passions (the fires of the heart) being turned to creative pursuits after years of violence in the Last War.",
						"{@b \"When towers rise from rubble.\"} These words could be a general reference to buildings rebuilt after a disaster, or perhaps a specific reference to a building project in the Fallen district of Sharn (where the wreckage of a fallen tower still dominates the neighborhood). Or it might refer to a resurgence in a family line, with notable scions arising from a family in decline; their \"reaching to the sky\" could reflect their lofty aspirations or their literal piloting of an airship.",
						"{@b \"Embers spring to life.\"} Hope kindling in the midst of despair is one obvious reading of these words. However, the reference to fires earlier in the verse doesn't require that the embers here be positive\u2014this could refer to a new, destructive fire raging to life after long lying dormant, or perhaps even the hatching of a red dragon's egg.",
						"{@b \"Five shall rise to cause a dragon's fall.\"} The best way to read this line is as a reference to the characters in your campaign (if there are more or fewer than five characters, you can adjust the number). That's especially fitting if a dragon is a major antagonist in your campaign\u2014or a dragonmarked house, a tyrannical ruler, or anything else easily symbolized as a dragon.",

								"Sharn Inquisitives (See {@book Chapter 4|EFA|4}). Daask, whose trade in the dangerous drug called dragon's blood is harming Sharn's population, or a powerful villain whose use of dragon's blood has brought about a draconic transformation.",

Lady Illmarrow, leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw (detailed in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}), who has draconic blood, or a fiendish overlord with a draconic form (perhaps Rak Tulkhesh, also detailed in {@i Eberron: Rising from the Last War}).",
								"With that climactic campaign end in mind, plot out a simple campaign arc\u2014a series of four apparently unconnected events, each one reflecting a line of the Prophecy fragment. At each step of the way, the characters might encounter others trying to steer the fulfillment of the Prophecy in various directions. Some of these figures might want the characters to topple the dragon who is the antagonist of the campaign; others might want the characters to bring about a different dragon's fall. Still others might hope for the five-headed dragon god Tiamat to rise and cause the fall of all the dragonmarked houses in fulfillment of the fragment's last line.",

But in Eberron (and perhaps other settings), characters might establish a permanent base of operations that isn't linked to a fixed location\u2014maybe on a sailing ship, a lightning rail cart, or even an airship. The DM decides whether to allow characters to establish a mobile Bastion, which uses the following alterations to the normal Bastion rules.",
						"A mobile Bastion has two basic requirements: it must be built in a vehicle form, and one of its special facilities must allow for propulsion. (The {@facility Lyrandar Helm|EFA}, {@facility Navigator's Helm|EFA}, and {@facility Orien Helm|EFA} described in this chapter fulfill that requirement.) If multiple characters combine their Bastions into a single vehicle, each Bastion must include the same kind of special facility that allows for propulsion, and in order for the vehicle to travel, the characters must all issue the Empower order to those facilities at the same time. In this case, however, the combined Bastion can travel more than 8 hours per day; the facility hirelings can operate the vehicle in shifts. Thus, a combined Bastion with at least three Navigator's Helm facilities can sail for 24 hours a day as the three hirelings trade off navigation in 8-hour shifts.",
						"If characters are traveling with their mobile Bastions, they can also have encounters and face obstacles just as if they were traveling away from their Bastions. When the DM is planning {@book obstacles for such a journey|XDMG|1|Journey Stage Challenges} (as described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|XDMG}), a potential consequence of an encounter or obstacle is the temporary loss of access to one or more of the Bastion's facilities, including the facility that allows propulsion.",
						"Players and the DM should work together to create a {@book Bastion map|XDMG|7|Bastion Map} that fits within the chosen vehicle. Facilities can be slightly larger or smaller than the rules in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|XDMG} specify, at the DM's discretion, in order to fit. A mobile Bastion can't have defensive walls."

								"The story of the Shadow Schism that sundered House Thuranni from its kindred in House Phiarlan is a tangled knot of mystery. The surface details of the tale seem simple enough. About twenty years ago, Baron Elar d'Thuranni ordered the assassination of the entire Paelion line, one of the branches of House Phiarlan. Supposedly, he acted to prevent the Paelions from carrying out a wicked plot that would have ended the Last War and exterminated the leaders of the other dragonmarked houses, leaving the Paelions as absolute rulers of Khorvaire.",
								"Was the Paelion plot real or fabricated by the sinister Order of the Emerald Claw? Was the schism orchestrated by agents of the Chamber to fulfill aspects of the Draconic Prophecy that speak of thirteen houses?",
								"Did the barons of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni plan the whole thing together to eliminate a mutual enemy? Whatever the truth behind the schism, it stands as the most significant consequence of the Last War to the dragonmarked. Just as the kingdom of Galifar shattered into smaller nations, the Last War left the dragonmarked houses broken, unsure of their role in the new world and their ties to the new political powers of Khorvaire, and the division of Thuranni from Phiarlan embodies that new reality.",
								"From his enclave in Regalport (in the Lhazaar Principalities), Baron Elar d'Thuranni rules a house that is a shadow of its united predecessor, similar in many ways to House Phiarlan. But while spies and assassins are contained within a secret sixth branch of House Phiarlan, separate from the house's artistic endeavors, the entertainers and artisans of House Thuranni are also its spies and assassins\u2014and its assassins outnumber its spies.",
