				"Domains of Delight are to the Feywild what Domains of Dread are to the Shadowfell: sequestered realms governed by powerful beings. Whereas a Domain of Dread is ruled by a Darklord, a Domain of Delight is ruled by an archfey\u2014the most powerful of Fey creatures. An archfey gives form to their Domain of Delight, shaping it in ways unique to their personality. Some Domains of Delight are bright and cheery, while others are gloomy, but each one reflects the emotional state of its ruler. A Domain of Delight can be as small as a few acres or as big as a country.",

						"The Feywild responds to unfettered emotion. It's not uncommon for flowers to turn and tremble if there's a heated argument nearby. If someone is filled with malice, their footprints might wither the grass under their feet or cause underground insects and worms to burrow to the surface. Birds chirp merrily in the presence of those who are joyous and squawk angrily at those who are perpetually dour. Nosy trees lean in to overhear whispers of conspiracy, eager for delicious tidbits they can gossip about later, and a rock might reshape itself to look like the creature that's happily sunning itself on the rock's surface.",
						"Time and distance in the Feywild are mutable, as is the plane's geography. Roads are uncommon, and those that exist are as likely to change as the land around them. Because the distance between locations is not fixed and dilations in time are commonplace, a journey that took one hour yesterday might take three days tomorrow. Feywild natives are accustomed to the plane's mutability. For them, it's no more peculiar than the sun rising and setting on a Material Plane world.",
						"Other features of the Feywild are described in the sections that follow. Think of them as a sampling of what the Feywild has to offer, for like the Material Plane, the Feywild is vast and diverse.",

							"name": "Seelie and Unseelie Fey",
							"entries": [
								"Seelie Fey and Unseelie Fey are two groups that often find themselves at odds. Seelie Fey cling to the trappings of civilization, value protocol, and uphold traditions. Unseelie Fey indulge their primal instincts, abhor adherence to protocol, and shun conformity. The two groups are not opposites morally or ethically; good and evil Fey can be found in both.",
								"Seelie and Unseelie Fey gather in courts. The Seelie court is called the Summer Court, and the Unseelie court is called the Gloaming Court. Both courts stretch to the far corners of the Feywild, so their representatives can be encountered almost anywhere on this plane of existence. The Summer Court and the Gloaming Court are by no means the only great Fey courts, but they're the most wellknown to creatures on the Material Plane and the most widespread.",
								"How the Summer Court and the Gloaming Court came to be is a mystery. Perhaps some Fey felt a deeper affinity with the natural world and chose to emulate it, while other Fey began to control nature, using magic to invent new ways of living. Whatever the case, innumerable Fey pursued these two paths, which became the two courts, and there have been squabbles between them ever since.",
								"Each court tries to destabilize and demoralize the other. Both Fey courts have spies who dig up dirt, sow seeds of dissent, and cause mischief. Captured spies are either ransomed or made examples of in various humiliating, nonlethal ways.",
								"Much of the gossip and chatter within the Feywild is fueled by the intrigue and drama between the two queens that rule the courts. Titania, the Summer Queen, is the regal and charismatic ruler of the Summer Court. Her court enjoys a tenuous peace with the unearthly ruler of the Gloaming Court, the Queen of Air and Darkness, who allows her kin to dabble in magic forbidden by the Seelie Court.",
								"Conflicts between the Fey courts are often ritualized. Representatives of both courts gather in an amphitheater or field to have heated debates or energetic dance competitions that simulate combat, and these events are often laced with bawdy insults and lewd gestures. Only on rare occasions do things get physical, and even then, the Fey do little more than bite, scratch, and hurl mud at each other.",
								"Every now and then, the two queens lock horns, causing tensions to rise throughout the Feywild. If only one of them can get her way, what would normally be a squabble can turn to bloodshed. But only the Fey queens can declare all-out war against each other, and it would take something extreme to have them abandon their relative peace and hurl their courts into violence and chaos.",
								"The Summer Court and the Gloaming Court have nothing akin to a mutual defense pact, and the very thought of one is greeted by jeers on both sides. If a rising army of fomorians or some other threat endangers one court, it's widely understood that the other court will not intervene unless it, too, is threatened by the same enemy.",
