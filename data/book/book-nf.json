Two thousand years ago, Netheril cowed Faerûn with its flying cities, archmages of unrivaled power, and mighty magical wonders. When Netheril fell, Faerûn's fabric shuddered. A huge swath of land shriveled into the Anauroch desert.",
				"Yet echoes of ancient Netheril persist. Flying cities' ruins dot Anauroch and the surrounding lands, tantalizing adventurers who dare face untold horrors for the promise of wealth and magic. Scholars and mages alike seek Netherese knowledge, whether to illuminate history or gain a fragment of Netheril's spellcasters' power.",
				"Ancient Netherese mages' wild experimentations with temporal magic warped the fabric of the time stream, making adventuring in the fallen empire possible. Hidden in the present day are time gates that lead to ancient Netheril and facilitate these adventures. Additionally, unfettered experimentation with Netherese magic in the past or present occasionally shunts present-day heroes into ancient Netheril.",

In ancient Netheril, the opportunities for adventure are vast and terrifying, from arcane squalls running amok to violent villains who siphon Netheril's magic.

Following this advancement, the alliance renamed itself Netheril, after King Nether the Elder, and all citizens learned the basics of rudimentary spellcasting.",

Using these lengthy documents, which came to be known as the {@i Nether Scrolls}, Netherese arcanists learned how to wield magic exponentially more powerful than anything they'd cast before. After centuries of magical progress and imperial expansion, the Netherese who mastered the power of the {@i Nether Scrolls} became the ruling class.",

Forever hungry for deeper magical understanding, the mages conducted wild magical experimentations from their aerial abodes. By the time the Shadowed Age arrived, these experimentations had dangerously taxed the fabric of the Weave, the tapestry of raw magic that flows through the world.

Deep underground, where the Anauroch desert stretches today, lived magic-obsessed creatures called phaerimm. The Netherese's weakening of the Weave also weakened the phaerimm, even limiting their lifespans, and the phaerimm hated the empire as a result.",
								"Using their abilities to siphon magic from the Weave, the phaerimm began to assault the mighty empire above. The phaerimm's magic caused the fall of some flying cities. Additionally, groups of phaerimm began strategically striking aboveground targets. These operations were so devastating that few victims survived. The Netherese became terrified of the phaerimm. The phaerimm's magic led to Anauroch's desertification, further contributing to the underclass's unrest.",
								"The phaerimm, once they'd dispatched Netheril, planned to build their own empire built on suffering and dominance over all who weren't their own. The phaerimm's assaults on Netheril chipped away at the empire's already crumbling facade, and the Netherese mages became desperate."

Karsus believed having absolute control over the Weave would allow him to save his people, though in his hubris, he also coveted the powers of a god. While Karsus cast his spell, the Weave surged and fluctuated.",
								"Mystryl, the only one who could mitigate the damage dealt to the Weave, countered Karsus during the spell's casting by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave asunder. This caused Karsus to die as well. For a time, magic vanished from the world, until the god of magic returned as Mystra.",
								"Without magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, though the flying city of Thultanthar managed to escape to the Shadowfell. Many mages died with Mystryl's sacrifice, while others suffered shattered minds. Once magic eventually returned, Netherese mages could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before. The Netherese empire began to crumble. Eventually, the land that once boasted the world's most powerful empire became a barren desert, the life and magic stripped from it thanks to the phaerimm's siphoning powers."

Thultanthar crashed to the ground in 1487 DR, landing in Myth Drannor in the Heartlands, and the Shadovar empire fell with it.
