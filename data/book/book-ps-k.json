						"From the beginning, I've approached all these Plane Shift projects as if I were tinkering in a workshop like the inventors of Kaladesh. I believe that some of the great beauty of Dungeons & Dragons comes from its tremendous flexibility, which includes not just the ability to make stuff up out of whole cloth, but also the ease with which you can take the existing pieces of the game apart and reassemble them into something new.",
						"That approach of combining pieces of different rules to form new rules continues for Kaladesh. As one of the designers of the artificer class for Eberron back in 2003, I tinkered for a long time with possible designs for such a class in Kaladesh, but I ultimately came to a couple of important conclusions. First, invention on Kaladesh is fundamentally democratic\u2014it's a skill anyone can learn, and it shouldn't be restricted to a single character class. And more importantly, designing an entirely new class is far beyond the scope of what I've set out to do in these articles.",
						"The D&D team works like the Consulate: they take a serious approach to the job of crafting a class, testing it for balance, sharing it for public playtest, and finetuning it before final publication. I'm more like a renegade inventor (having left the D&D team for the Magic team a couple of years ago), fiddling around in my workshop and unleashing my inventions on the public without the same degree of safety testing. But with that said, the D&D team has just released an artificer class for playtesting, and you should feel free to tinker with that class to adapt it for your Kaladesh campaign. {@note See the final version of the {@class Artificer|TCE|artificer class}.}",
						"Of course, you'll find a lot of information about aether-powered devices and invention in this document, in keeping with the spirit of Kaladesh. But it's more along the lines of rearranging the building blocks and altering the appearance of existing magic items, rather than creating a lot of new things. If you want your character to look like the guy on the Dispersal Technician card, just give him a {@item ring of the ram}.",
						"As always, the starting point for this document was {@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering\u2014Kaladesh}. This document is designed to help you turn that book's adventure hooks and story seeds into a resource for your campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition of the D&D rules, which you can {@link find here|https://dnd.wizards.com/what-is-dnd/basic-rules}. And even without the book, you can find lore about Kaladesh on {@link the Magic web site|https://magic.wizards.com/}.",

				"Kaladesh is a living work of art\u2014a vibrant, beautiful plane where anything is possible. Optimism, innovation, and the spirit of creativity fuel an intoxicating renaissance of invention and artifice across Kaladesh. Its inhabitants frequently assert that \"anything can be built,\" and brilliant inventors seem to prove that saying every day.",
				"Clockwork automatons walk the streets, acting as servants and bodyguards, soldiers and sentries, mounts, and even pets. Soaring airships provide transport both within and between the cities and villages of the plane, and carry prospectors high into the sky to draw on limitless reserves of magical aether. Intricate and ornate whirling thopters flit over marketplaces, carrying messages, gathering information, and driving away gremlin infestations. Elegant interlocking gear mechanisms raise and lower bridges over canals. Exquisite tools gleam like jewelry, incorporated into the bright and colorful fashions of artisans, prospectors, and inventors alike. In all these fabulous constructions, intricate design and graceful beauty are prized almost as much as efficient function. The artifice that produces these works is viewed as the ultimate form of creative and intellectual expression\u2014both stemming from and further feeding the inventive spirit of the plane.",
				"Kaladesh is bright and hopeful, and its people are inspired. Every invention is an astonishing work of art, holding the potential to dramatically improve quality of life. The natural world mirrors the beauty and harmony of the plane's cities, with gracefully curving trees, eddying streams, sculpted mountains, and sapphire skies punctuated with brilliant blue streams of aether.",

								"Kaladesh owes its bright existence to the tangible presence of aether\u2014a raw form of magical energy that fills the space between planes. Aether seeps into Kaladesh, and has become a critical part of the environment as well as the foundation of contemporary civilization. The skies are full of it, the plants and trees bend and twist to be closer to it, and flowing waterways trace patterns beneath it. The ingenious inventor Avaati Vya developed a way to refine volatile aether into a potent and safe fuel, a process that has made all the inventions and contrivances of society possible. For six decades, Kaladesh's greatest minds have been devising ever more wondrous ways to put aether to use. From airships to animal-like constructs, from cogwork trains to musical artifacts, from medical devices to full-body mechanized suits, the creative possibilities are endless."

						"The city of Ghirapur and the towns and villages of the surrounding region are like an enormous, precise cogwork machine, managed and supported by the Consulate. The eleven consuls and countless bureaucrats who make up the Consulate maintain the order of society and ensure that all its interlocking cogs turn in harmony. An important part of this work, of course, is facilitating the sanctioned distribution of aether and maintaining the aether-powered infrastructure that undergirds civilized life on Kaladesh. The Consulate believes that the wonders and conveniences of an aether-based society should be accessible to all. Thus, the consuls hold that the process of obtaining and distributing aether, as well as the construction and sale of aether-based inventions, must be standardized and regulated.",
						"The Consulate employs hundreds of theorists and engineers to design machines, devices, and infrastructure. True innovations are valued and rewarded. But the value of any invention is tempered by the need to make the conveniences of an aether-driven society available to all citizens. Thus, efficient construction is more important than any artistic expression of individuality, so that inventions can be mass-produced in Consulate foundries and made widely available.",
						"Standing to various degrees in opposition to the Consulate is a disparate group of inventors, tinkers, thieves, and artists collectively designated as \"renegades.\" By portraying the renegades as a monolithic entity resembling a criminal gang, the Consulate tries to sway public opinion against them. But in reality, the so-called renegades have a wide range of goals and motivations, different methods, and varying degrees of disdain or loathing for the Consulate. The only thing all renegades share is a record of some past subversive activity viewed as criminal action under Consulate law. This \"subversion,\" though, is often as innocuous as bypassing the strict regulations governing invention and the distribution of aether.",

Simple self-drawn carriages might cost no more than the {@item carriage|PHB|carriage in the Player's Handbook} (100 gp, the equivalent of a common magic item), while the dragsters used in races in Ovalchase can cost five times that amount (as much as an uncommon magic item). Flying vehicles are significantly more expensive. A small sky skiff or copter might be a rare item, and a larger skyship should be considered very rare or even legendary."

Alternatively, they might be Consulate agents trying to suppress the rebellion\u2014or perhaps infiltrate it. The rebellion could also be the backdrop for a campaign focused more on urban intrigue, or it could interrupt the regular activities of such a campaign. Aether supplies might be significantly constrained in such a campaign, increasing the cost of creating and using aether-powered devices. Acquiring aether could then easily become the focus of a number of adventures."

Beyond the reach of Ghirapur's aether pipelines, such characters might need to dig for aether geodes to power their inventions\u2014or they might be traveling on an airship that can collect and refine aether from the aethersphere. The nature of what the characters might find out in the wilds is for you to decide. Such a campaign might even include threats with a more traditional D&D feel, all infused with the magic of aether."
