Like everything else in D&D the deck is a tool you can customize to suit the needs of your table, You might include all the cards to capture the wild unpredictability of fate, use only cards that fit a certain theme or yield particular results, or select a few specific cards that precisely fit your adventure. You can even invent new cards. You can find examples Of how to customize the deck to suit your table, including card lists, in {@book chapter 2 of The Book of Many Things|BMT|1}.",
