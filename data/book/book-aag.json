						"The {@b Astral Plane} is, quite literally, the plane of stars. More precisely, it is where the stars and portals to the heavens reside\u2014an infinitely vast celestial void that surrounds all the worlds of the Material Plane.",
						"Every D&D world\u2014whether round, flat, or some other shape\u2014exists in an airless void known as {@b Wildspace}. A world might be solitary, or it might have neighbors: one or more suns, worlds, moons, asteroids, comets, or other bodies. This neighborhood of celestial and planetary bodies is called a {@b Wildspace system}.",
						"In Wildspace, the Material Plane and the Astral Plane overlap. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and are effectively on both of those planes at once. If you were to leave your home world and continue outward until you neared the edge of your Wildspace system, you would begin to see a faint, silvery haze. By traveling into this haze, you pass from Wildspace into the {@b Astral Sea}, more colorfully known as the Silver Void. The deeper into the Astral Sea you travel, the thicker and brighter the haze becomes, but the stars that shine through it are always visible. Wildspace and the Astral Sea together comprise the Astral Plane.",
						"The Astral Sea, like Wildspace, is a void; however, it is not an airless one. Here, you can breathe normally and exist indefinitely, never aging and never needing food or drink. You can propel yourself through the Astral Sea with the power of your mind alone, though many astral voyagers wisely travel in well-armed ships, for this place is the home of a host of fearsome creatures. Here travelers might find the petrified hulks of dead gods and swirling pools of color that serve as portals to other planes of existence. (For more information about {@book color pools|DMG|2|Color Pools}, see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.)",
						"Much in the way that oars and strong winds enable travel by sea on terrestrial worlds, magic items called {@item Spelljamming Helm|AAG|spelljamming helms} are used to propel and steer ships through Wildspace and the Astral Sea. A {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} customarily takes the form of an ornate chair in which the ship's pilot sits. To attune to a {@item spelljamming helm|AAG}, one must be a spellcaster.

While moving at its flying speed, a spelljamming ship is generally as maneuverable as a seafaring vessel of a similar size.

						"The Rock traces its roots back to roughly 170 years ago, when the eponymous Captain Bral established a pirate refuge here. The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral's death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership of the city.",
						"Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock\u2014that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock's first overlord. Under Prince Cozar's long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.",
						"Upon Cozar's death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.",
						"Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days. Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space just beyond the asteroid's air envelope. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar's younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.",
						"Though his place on the throne is secure for now, Prince Andru is merely one player in a maze of political intrigue. He has a host of agents and forces loyal to him, but he must act with consideration, since he has opponents who would rather see Bral ruled by a more ineffectual leader or by a council that could more easily be influenced. Andru maintains his strong base of support because he is a serious and intelligent person\u2014often likened to his grandfather, Prince Cozar, in this regard\u2014and he isn't easily intimidated."
