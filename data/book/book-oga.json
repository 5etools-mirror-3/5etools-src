				"Ever since I joined the D&D team in 2010, I've thought about a future where the grung were \"a thing\" again. These long-forgotten amphibians from the 2nd Edition Greyhawk setting had captured my heart and imagination long ago. So, it was with some amount of grit that I entered them into the fray of creatures to be selected as part of Volo's Guide to Monsters. They certainly weren't the favored choice, but in the end when we each received a \"golden ticket\" to give to one creature. Despite jeers from my coworkers, it was clear to me what my choice would be. Grung for life!!!",
				"Since then, I was given the opportunity to reimagine them, rewrite them, and include them among creatures that can potentially exist in any D&D campaign setting... and then it happened. Someone asked me to DM a table of players during the Stream of Annihilation. With the ALL-STAR cast of celebrities that would be attending, plus superstar DMs like Chris Perkins and Mike Mearls to follow, I had to find something that would set me apart from the rest... or at least confirm to the world that I'm simply an eccentric goofball... either way sounded great to me. At this point I mused out loud... \"What if my players were ALL grung?\" The rest is history... and the future. You can even watch it on YouTube.",
				"I want to thank these individuals... all fantastic DMs as well, that brought the grung in the Stream of Annihilation game to life. Matt Colville as b'Loop; Mark Hulmes as b'Lip; Adam Koebel as b'Lahp; and Nadja Otikor as c'Ahbülos... And I want to thank those who continue to 'Grung it up!' on Twitch with me... Satine Phoenix as d'Ahten'khan; Ruty Rutenberg as b'Leep; Lauren Urban as b'Ang'r'Ang; and special welcome to my new player... Cig Neutron as the albino dwarf monk Mee'Yah-Ghee.",
				"You've all made me a VERY HOPPY DM!",
