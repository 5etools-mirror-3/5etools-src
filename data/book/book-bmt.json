				"Welcome to {@i The Book of Many Things}, whose twenty-two chapters give you character options, magic items, spells, monsters, ready-to-play adventures, DM advice, and setting elements designed to be dropped into your own campaign. And tying those chapters together is a legendary magic item that every player both dreads and longs for: the {@item Deck of Many Things}.",
				"For decades, DMs have used this infamous deck in their games, often with explosive results. Characters have been whisked off to extradimensional prisons, slain by death itself, lost levels, and earned the enmity of powerful fiends. But they've also gained vast wealth or a stronghold of their own, rewound time to reverse disaster, or suddenly advanced in level far beyond the other characters in the group. The awesome powers of the {@item Deck of Many Things} have given it a reputation as a game breaker. An encounter with the deck can spell the end of an otherwise successful campaign, as the DM's carefully prepared storyline and the players' lovingly created characters are scattered by the winds of fate to the corners of the multiverse.",
				"But it doesn't have to be that way. You can tailor the {@item Deck of Many Things} to your campaign, shaping it to fit your needs and the tastes of your players. You can stack the deck with low-level effects that prompt roleplaying instead of mechanical changes or create a deck that has only good cards (or bad ones!) in it. You can do all this without losing the wonder of the deck: its unique nature as a physical object that players\u2014not just their characters\u2014can hold in their hands.",
				"This book will show you how to tailor the deck for your game. This chapter presents a history of the deck throughout each edition of Dungeons & Dragons, then outlines the other chapters of this book, which are grouped by theme: DM options, character creation options, astrology-themed options, adventure locations, and finally adversaries and rivals.",

						"The {@item Deck of Many Things} is as old as D&D, but it's had many variations over almost fifty years.",
						"The deck first appeared in print in 1975, in the pages of {@i Greyhawk}, the first supplement for the Dungeons & Dragons game. This earliest version of the deck established mechanical effects associated with the various cards. The deck was assembled with the face cards, aces, and jokers from an ordinary deck of playing cards. There were only eighteen cards in the deck, and none of them had names. But from the beginning, the deck was intended to be represented by a physical object players could hold.",

								"With the publication of the first {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} in 1979, the most recognizable aspects of the {@item Deck of Many Things} were established. Here, the names of the cards first appeared, and the deck was expanded to twenty-two cards. These changes signaled the deck's transition from something inspired by playing cards to one inspired by the tarot; a traditional tarot deck also has twenty-two named cards known as the major arcana. The {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} also introduced the idea that there was more than one version of the deck; there was also a more common and less powerful version with only thirteen cards.",

										"A different version of the deck appeared in 1983 in the pages of {@i Dragon} 77. \"The Tarot Deck of Many Things,\" written by Michael Lowry, reimagined the deck as a new magic item. The {@i Tarot Deck of Many Things} was a unique artifact created by \"the most powerful god of fate in the universe.\" It could be used to answer questions and reveal the future in the way of traditional tarot, and each of its seventy-eight cards had a unique effect when drawn.",
										"In 1989, the {@item Deck of Many Things} expanded again. \"Luck of the Draw\" in {@i Dragon} 148 explored the deck through a conversation between a pompous wizard named Basil and his mercenary agent, a warrior named Jared. In this story, author Robin Jenkins offered answers for some of the deck's most enigmatic questions: who made the deck, and why? Jenkins, through Jared, suggested the deck\u2014or, more properly, decks, since the cards were rare but not unique\u2014were created by gods of luck dwelling on the plane of Concordant Opposition (known now as the Outlands) to test the greed of hapless adventurers. The cards were distributed throughout the world by leprechauns, who were familiar with such tests as custodians of the pots of gold at the ends of rainbows. Jenkins's expansion of the deck was unofficial, but it was illuminating, since the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} detailed how the deck worked but didn't explain what the deck was or how it came to exist. Those questions were left for individual Dungeon Masters to figure out\u2014or simply leave unanswered.",
										"That same issue of {@i Dragon} also included the first physical replica of the deck, illustrated by George Barr and printed on card stock in the center of the magazine. At last, when characters found the {@item Deck of Many Things} in a treasure hoard, the DM could offer them a physical deck to draw from. Barr also detailed the backs of the cards for the first time. No design on the backs of the cards had ever been mentioned before, but here it gained a pair of dragons\u2014one white, one black\u2014embodying the deck's equal balance of positive and negative cards.",
										"Around the same time, the adventure \"House of Cards\" appeared in {@i Dungeon} 19. This adventure by Randy Maxwell began as an urban sandbox with the characters investigating a thieves' guild. The guild's headquarters concealed a temple to Mask, the god of thieves in the Forgotten Realms, and the doors to the complex were insidiously trapped. Each of the twenty-two doors had one card from the {@item Deck of Many Things} built into it, so the door couldn't be opened without drawing the card. Moreover, the entire complex had been bolstered against an array of methods the characters might have taken to avoid interacting with the cards. To explore the dungeon, the characters had to draw every single card from the deck. This quickly became a resource-management puzzle: when the players knew one of their number would be imprisoned by the Donjon card, for example, or have their soul separated from their body by the Void card, how did they proceed?"

								"When D&D was reimagined in its third edition, the new {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} included the {@item Deck of Many Things}. The mechanical effects of the cards and the card names remained largely unchanged from the first and second edition versions, but there were two important differences. Tarot cards had become much more familiar to players and were easier to find, so DMs were instructed how to build a {@item Deck of Many Things} from tarot cards in addition to playing cards. More importantly, the deck became a minor artifact, formally representing key features of the deck from previous editions: it was a magic item that characters couldn't create on their own."

								"But in the fourth edition of D&D, artifacts were more than just magic items that couldn't be duplicated; they had minds of their own and pursued secret purposes. The deck sought to sow chaos and topple powerful leaders regardless of whether they were good or evil. Characters who helped the deck pursue these goals were rewarded with favorable cards, while those who thwarted the deck were forced to draw multiple cards and keep the worst.",
								"A new origin for the deck was put forward but not confirmed in {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}: the deck was a gift from an archfey to a mighty emperor. As the archfey predicted, the emperor was unable to resist using the deck to cast his own future, and the deck shattered his empire. The deck also gained magical powers distinct from the cards' effects: wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks could use the deck to empower their spells.",
								"The {@item Deck of Many Things} was central to {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}. Cards were scattered throughout the adventure, and the characters were charged with collecting them. Each card had unique powers, so characters could enjoy using the cards before the deck was fully assembled. But there was also a random factor inspired by the use of tarokka cards in the classic adventure {@i Ravenloft}. The DM could draw cards from the deck to determine the identity of their patron, the location of each card, and the scene of the adventure's denouement. To facilitate this, the adventure included another re-creation of the deck, with art by William O'Connor. (O'Connor's designs also appeared when Magic: The Gathering drew on the {@item Deck of Many Things} for a set inspired by the Forgotten Realms.) Like \"House of Cards,\" {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey} forced characters to interact with the {@item Deck of Many Things}, but it rewarded them with new powers instead of punishing them and blocking all efforts to escape the deck."

When you use the deck in this way, drawing from it is less like pulling the lever on a cosmic slot machine and more like allowing a character to select a new story for themself without being allowed to know that story ahead of time.",
								"With this narrative approach to the {@item Deck of Many Things}, you decide how to weave the events triggered by cards into your campaign. For example, a character who draws the Knight card might meet a warrior along the side of the road, in a tavern, or even trapped in a dangerous dungeon; by freeing the warrior, the character earns the warrior's loyalty. A character who draws the Gem card might find a rich store of jewels in their next treasure hoard, or they might inherit great wealth when a relative dies. Many of the chapters in this book include advice to help you work the effects of their cards into your campaign story.",
								"Using the deck's effects as events in your campaign poses an interesting question: is the deck predicting those events or causing them? If a character draws the Flames card, and soon after, minions of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} (see {@book chapter 20|BMT|19|Aurnozci, the Caged Worm}) try to capture them, is this a direct result of drawing the card, or would the demons have attacked them anyway? {@i The Book of Many Things} doesn't answer this question; the answer is up to you and your players.",
								"When you take a narrative approach to the {@item Deck of Many Things}, don't put off card effects for too long. It's okay for players to wonder for a session or two exactly when and how the effects will manifest, and you can use that time to devise clever and memorable ways to interpret the effects and keep the players in suspense. For example, a beloved ally might come to hate a character who draws the Rogue card, and that ally might conceal their hatred for several sessions before revealing it in a moment of sudden treachery. But new stories soon crowd out the old, and players might not be impressed if a card takes too long to manifest."

Nevertheless, the stone walls are tall and undamaged, and an astronomical observatory boasting several telescopes surmounts the second floor of the inner structure.

Gremorly was a necromancer and misanthrope who had little patience for the living; he resolved to use the keep to create and house a ghostly army he would use to seize power. Gremorly performed a ritual that turned Sovereign Keep into a ghost trap: anyone who dies within the castle walls rises as an incorporeal spirit, trapped within the castle. Then, he waited. When adventurers came to investigate the seemingly abandoned keep, Gremorly murdered them and trapped their ghosts. But fortune recently turned against Gremorly when a behir entered the keep seeking a nest. It slew Gremorly, who became a victim of his own ritual.",

In that adventure, Gardmore Abbey was located in the Nentir Vale, and the site had ties to the minotaur empire below Thunderspire Mountain. You, however, can situate the ruin and the fortified hill it sits atop anywhere in your campaign world. The layout of Gardmore Abbey was inspired by a real fortress atop the French island Mont-Saint-Michel, so you might place the ruins on a similar island accessible only by a narrow path that's underwater at high tide.",

The deck lies in the hoard of Mekkalath, a powerful dragon, who nests in the ruins. Few heroes are brave enough to face Mekkalath in battle, though resourceful characters can obtain the deck in other ways. But once the deck is in their possession, their troubles have just begun.",

						"A thousand years ago, minotaurs built a temple to Bahamut and other gods of good under a towering hill. But a cult dedicated to the demon lord Baphomet infiltrated the temple, and its members gradually took over the temple's leadership. When the cultists revealed their worship of Baphomet, the minotaurs dedicated to Bahamut rose up to reclaim the temple. After a bloody conflict, the survivors fled, leaving the temple abandoned.",
						"Hundreds of years later, monastic knights chose the hill for their order's home and began building a defensive structure atop the site. A massive wall surrounded much of the hill, leaving only its impassible western face unguarded. The knights built an abbey, a barrack, a memorial hall, and more at the summit of the hill, and dug catacombs in which to bury the order's honored dead. While excavating these catacombs, the knights discovered the minotaur temple. The captain of the order sealed the minotaur ruins to keep them secret.",
						"As decades passed, a village grew within the fortress's outer wall, and the knights became a local power. They warred against wicked foes, including followers of the serpent god Zehir and an infamous hobgoblin warlord, whose infernal stronghold they sacked, carrying away many trophies\u2014including a {@item Deck of Many Things}. The legendary magic item was hidden in the vaults and warded with powerful spells to prevent its detection and theft.",
						"But five hundred years ago, a vengeful army laid siege to the abbey. The outcome of the battle was still in doubt when the captain of the abbey, Havarr Nenlast, drew from the {@item Deck of Many Things} in an attempt to turn the tide. When he drew the Skull card, the terrifying Undead created by that card (see {@book chapter 19|BMT|18}) detected the deck at last. Within minutes, more Undead arrived at the abbey and began slaughtering everyone in their path. Havarr and the other knights of the abbey were killed, along with most of the invaders, and the deck was scattered.",
						"Centuries passed. Refugees from the besieging army settled in the ruined village on the hill's lower slopes, but in time they returned home. Mekkalath, a {@creature young red dragon}, claimed the catacombs under the abbey as his lair. Adventurers reassembling the scattered deck killed a beholder trapped in the abbey's watchtower, but Mekkalath drove the adventurers off and seized the deck.",
						"Eventually Mekkalath outgrew the vaults. Eager to show off his glory, he moved his hoard\u2014which now included a {@item Deck of Many Things}\u2014to the surface ruins. The hill was gradually transformed by his magical nature, birthing lava flows, plumes of flame, and clouds of smoke.",
						"A short time ago, a comet streaked across the sky above the abbey, signifying fell portents. The comet's otherworldly energy brought the slain beholder back as a death tyrant and drew the attention of minotaur scholars hoping to uncover the ancient temple beneath the abbey. Individuals throughout the multiverse who seek a {@item Deck of Many Things} now look to the ruins of Gardmore Abbey."

They might be hunting Mekkalath, whose depredations threaten everyone for hundreds of miles around his lair. They might be drawn by the foreboding comet that recently streaked over the site. Scholars remember the keep's connection to the {@item Deck of Many Things}; anyone seeking the deck could be drawn to the abbey, heedless of danger.",

The minotaurs aren't aggressive, and their camp can serve as a home base for characters who approach them peacefully. A githyanki delegation based in a tower in the village might see the characters as a path to earning Mekkalath's goodwill. Heroes might confront the {@creature death tyrant} trapped within the abbey's tower, draw it into a fight with Mekkalath, or ignore it completely. Stubborn angels, {@creature salamander} servitors, and a trio of hags all create further complications.",
						"The threats on the hill span a wide range of difficulty; low- and moderate-level characters will need to rely on diplomacy, stealth, and trickery to claim the deck, while high-level characters might stride boldly into Mekkalath's lair and challenge the dragon directly. Most monsters infesting the ruins of Gardmore Abbey won't pursue characters who retreat from the hill to tend their wounds. Characters have the opportunity to return another day, with a new plan to defeat Mekkalath and obtain the deck.",

				"Though many cards in the {@item Deck of Many Things} depict individuals, only one card bears a proper name: {@creature Euryale|BMT}, a baneful card with a medusa-like visage. Many sages have pondered who this individual is and why she appears in the deck, speculating that perhaps {@creature Euryale|BMT} is a fearsome demigod or the wielder of a destructive curse. But the truth is simple: the {@item Deck of Many Things} was created through the actions of the person who held {@creature Euryale|BMT} most dear.",
				"Long ago, the zealous ruler of a small coastal kingdom had a daughter he named {@creature Asteria|BMT}, or \"shining star\" in the language of the kingdom, for the stars shone auspiciously on her birth. But {@creature Asteria|BMT} defied his expectations. While other nobles' children happily played with their bevy of toys, {@creature Asteria|BMT} intently focused on cataloging every constellation she could find. When other children greeted their parents with high heads and laughter, {@creature Asteria|BMT} smiled firmly at the ground. Over time, {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s father grew discontented with his daughter, frustrated by his many failed attempts to mold {@creature Asteria|BMT} into a person who matched the ideas in his head. The princess grew up isolated and independent, resenting the unending pressure others placed on her to be someone other than herself.",
				"One afternoon, as {@creature Asteria|BMT} swam alone as a reprieve from her peers, a rip current swallowed her. Waves battered her against the rocks, then carried her unconscious body far from the kingdom's shore to a secret grotto in which the reclusive medusa {@creature Euryale|BMT} lived alone. Despite {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s anxiety (she was painfully aware that even kind folk feared her petrifying gaze), she tended to {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s wounds. When {@creature Asteria|BMT} awoke, the young woman didn't panic. Instead, the pair chatted throughout the night, talking of the stars, the sea, and everything else they had longed to share with someone for so long.",

				"{@creature Asteria|BMT} stayed until her wounds were healed. But rather than return to a father who was always disappointed in her, she decided to let her father assume she was dead. The secluded grotto became her new home. Over the years, {@creature Euryale|BMT} taught {@creature Asteria|BMT} how to be a steward of the land, while {@creature Asteria|BMT} provided companionship, freely sharing with {@creature Euryale|BMT} all the esoteric interests she had pursued as a child. The two were sisters in all but blood, for {@creature Euryale|BMT} didn't pressure {@creature Asteria|BMT} to conform to her ways or to look her in the eye, and {@creature Asteria|BMT} didn't view {@creature Euryale|BMT} as a terrifying monster. Their existences blissfully intertwined for years, with neither forcing the other to be anything but themselves.",
				"This peace was not to last, for {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s father never gave up hope his daughter still lived. After a decade of searching, he found her new home and ordered his soldiers to retrieve her through any means necessary. The idyllic grotto was overrun by violence, and although {@creature Euryale|BMT} defended her home and her sister with fervent abandon, turning many of the intruders to stone, both women were captured and taken to the coastal kingdom.",
				"Determined to rein in his wayward daughter, the king locked {@creature Asteria|BMT} away in a keep and sentenced {@creature Euryale|BMT} to death. {@creature Asteria|BMT}, horrified, tried everything to save her dearest friend, but her pleas were dismissed. In desperation, she broke out of the keep, but she was overwhelmed by guards. Only then, after exhausting all options, did {@creature Asteria|BMT} give in to rage, screaming at the stars that were her namesake, searching for an answer.",
				"An answer came, but it was not the one {@creature Asteria|BMT} hoped for. Istus, a god of fate, heard the princess and visited her in the keep that night. Every door opened for Istus, and invisible to every guard, she led {@creature Asteria|BMT} onto the cliffs, where\u2014pointing out the constellations that governed {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s and {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s fates\u2014Istus explained that nothing could be done. It was {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s destiny to be a dutiful daughter and princess, and it was {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s fate to be remembered forever as a tragic villain. {@creature Asteria|BMT} wasn't sure which part of this destiny she resented more.",
				"\"We don't get to choose our stories,\" the god explained.",
				"\"Don't we?\" {@creature Asteria|BMT} replied. \"I chose to see {@creature Euryale|BMT} differently, as she did me. That was enough to change our stories once, years ago. Let me change them again.\"",
				"Swayed by {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s conviction, Istus reluctantly admitted that {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s and {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s fates could be rewritten, but the consequences of such an action were impossible to predict. Both women could get new destinies, but they might be no better than the last, and they could be worse. But {@creature Asteria|BMT} was adamant, so Istus reached into the sky and pulled down twenty-two constellations to form a deck of oracle cards: the first {@item Deck of Many Things}. Placing thirteen of these cards face up, one by one, Istus rewrote {@creature Asteria|BMT} and {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s story.",
				"Armed with her new destiny, {@creature Asteria|BMT} rescued {@creature Euryale|BMT}, and the two have since had many grand adventures together. In time, {@creature Euryale|BMT} longed once more for a quiet life; the two women found a site in the Outlands that reminded them of the grotto that had once been their home, and {@creature Euryale|BMT} retired there from adventuring. {@creature Asteria|BMT}, however, still felt a fervent desire to defend others from the injustice of destiny. Taking up the symbol of the medusa as an icon of protection, strength, and her dearest friend, {@creature Asteria|BMT} has continued her journey alone. But Istus's act echoed through the multiverse, and the original {@item Deck of Many Things} reflected across the planes, manifesting in varied forms throughout the cosmos.",

In comparison to many, I'm new to this vast multiverse of ours, and I still have much to learn. I'm not a demigod, a mighty archmage, or a renowned witch queen; I'm simply {@creature Asteria|BMT}, a woman who looked fate in the eyes and chose to rewrite her story.",
								"You've seen my thoughts scattered throughout this book. I've seen the power each card in a Deck of Many Things possesses, and I know how that power can affect individual lives. I've battled those slain by the decks' machinations and walked alongside knights who protect innocents who come across a deck, I've seen how the decks inspire people, and I've witnessed adventurers explore extradimensional prisons and learn new magic. I know the patterns and puzzles written in the stars, for I was there when the first Deck of Many Things was created from them.",
								"I've forged my life with my own hands and made it into one weird, dangerous, and amazing adventure, and I wouldn't have it any other way\u2014though a certain god of fate might disagree with me.",
								"But does it really matter what Istus thinks? Or anyone, god or mortal? We can write about fate until our pens run out of ink, but in the end, the only person who can define your destiny is you.",
								"It all traces back to the Deck of Many Things, that strange and infamous thing whose manifestations have altered the fates of many for better and for worse. Travelers who meet me often ask my opinion about the decks. When they ask, I can tell some have already made up their minds. Whether they view the decks as abominations, tools, or their only hope, they don't want my opinion, just my validation.",
								"For those who truly want my opinion, here it is: quantifying Decks of Many Things as wholly good or bad misses the point. Even without a deck's interference, life is a chaotic and nonsensical jumble of joyous highs and miserable lows, right choices and wrong decisions, and everything in between. Each deck just gives us a way to tap into that chaos and make it our own. It's just one of many ways to take your story into your own hands.",
								"If I've learned anything, it's that your story isn't over until you say it is\u2014until you place that very last sentence on the page and let the ink dry. So chase your dreams, take a chance, and maybe draw a card or two. Whatever happens, it's sure to be an amazing story.",
