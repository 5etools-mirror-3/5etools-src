								"Nature, or the forest, might be quite the distance from our homes, Twitch streams, or stages where we play RPGs like {@i 5th Edition} (because oddly enough that's the magical world we live in now). We throw dice onto surfaces made of trees whose history we are woefully clueless of. Did the tree have a story, or a family of owls living in it, or a fox kit that sheltered a storm beneath its branches? We don't know these tales as we weave our own, but the connection is still there. We're still tromping through the wilderness and smelling the fresh air and fearing its dangers, even if it's in our imagination.",
								"Storytelling on its own has always been connected to nature. Legends of animals as gods or animals as human-like protagonists permeate all cultures. The Native American stories of the trickster Raven, the Medieval fable of the {@i Owl and the Nightingale}, or something as obvious and simple as {@i Grimm's Fairy Tales} are all examples of how the natural world around us has shaped storytelling. The magic of animals and their usually unseen lives intrigues us, sparks our imagination, and we see a lot of ourselves in them when we finally slow down enough to look. Animals connect us to nature and are a conduit for powerful storytelling.",
								"This is why I believe roleplaying games have had such a resurgence in the past few years, because we're looking for a connection to the world around us. We're looking for a way to get away from screens, to forget about our complicated lives, and to live as heroes with problems we can solve, not just listen to on the news and worry about. We can help people, we can be heroes, and we have magic. Even in the imagination, these things are incredibly powerful.",
								"In Humblewood, we're going back to our roots as storytellers, using nature and the animals around us to adventure in a world of fantasy. We have so much technology surrounding us every day, getting out into nature isn't an option for many. Our jobs are time consuming, our lives are hard and complicated, our food is grown in places we will never see and sits on a shelf for our consumption wrapped in plastic. These things disconnect us from the story of nature, from the story of life and the changing of seasons and our connection to the world around us. In reality, even the humble pigeon has an interesting life, we just don't see it as we pass them on city streets without giving them a second look.",
								"I've loved birds since I can remember, they've always been how I connected to nature. I've rescued birds since I was 10 and I've worked with the smallest of hummingbirds to the massive moody, Red Tailed hawk named Ivan whose mew I cleaned in college. When I lived in Los Angeles, I began rescuing pigeons because they were everywhere, forgotten pets of colonists and invasive to the habitat they lived in. These birds were smart, funny, and ignored by almost every animal shelter you took them to. They were the lost and forgotten of the animal world, and that's why I fell in love with them. They had stories to tell, and every one of them has their own personality and quirks.",
								"Humans are not that different from animals. If we pay attention to them, we can understand them, save them, live with them, and honor them. The more compassion we have for animals the better our world will be. Telling their stories is just as important as telling our own, and helps us connect to and have compassion for the other creatures on our planet. So I encourage you to make your own legends in Humblewood, and then go to the forest and see them for yourself. Maybe they'll have a story of their own to tell you, too.",

								"When approaching the art direction for Humblewood, I wanted to express that this is a world full of vibrant, diverse characters, living in an expansive forest with a rich and intricate history. The driving force behind Humblewood as a concept was the desire to create a visually compelling world that felt alive, and that meant a world that could feel wonderful and welcoming, magical and mysterious. It also meant a world full of secrets, hidden dangers, and obstacles for a party of adventurers to overcome.",
								"When I was young, the films and books I devoured with the most enthusiasm were the ones that appealed to audiences both young and old, whose characters may happen to be adorable woodland animals, but still bravely explored a mosaic of complex, confronting themes that we continue to puzzle over well into our adult years. These are the stories that left a significant impression on me, that I continue to revisit to this day.",
								"Roleplaying games are wonderful for many reasons, one being that they can provide a form of escape, or they can mirror reality. They can help us understand and process experiences in our own lives through an entirely different lens, and they give you a unique kind of freedom to be whoever or whatever you want to be, options for which there is no shortage in Humblewood\u2014whether you are a sneaky mapach, a brave little strig, or a cunning corvum with a secret heart of gold, the only limit, as ever, is your imagination.",
								"As artists we have to give careful consideration to every facet of the world, certainly the designs of our main characters and our myriad of monsters, but also what a character's home might look like, what kind of fabrics they might wear, and how should we design this bottle of vintage vulpin-crafted elderberry wine? We have illustrated forests flooded with beams of light, tangled and treacherous swamps you must battle your way through with determination, and cosy interiors where you can almost smell the jerbeen-sized loaves baking in the oven. The love is very often in the details, just as some of the most significant moments in a campaign can be the quiet ones, the small words exchanged at the campfire, or the tiny clues indicating a much larger mystery to unravel.",
								"Creating this project has been an unforgettable journey, full of as many surprises, twists and turns as the overgrown paths of Humblewood itself. I have had an affinity for nature and animals my entire life, which has been my primary source of inspiration for much of my personal work. I remember when I first sat down and sketched the first iteration of a brave little knight owl, who we have now named Riffin, and I could never have imagined in that moment how the idea behind this little owl would evolve into a fully realised world, lovingly crafted by our team of designers, writers and artists, for players to explore.",
								"I am beyond excited for you all to take your first steps into this world, uncover some of its secrets during your adventures, experience its stories, and come away with many of your own stories to tell!",

						"In the far away world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and the humblefolk. Together they share the Wood and its bountiful resources.",
						"In the early years, the birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest. These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the \"Bandit Coalition.\" To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest's canopy. Joining forces with the humblefolk, the birdfolk army, known as the \"Perch Guard\", drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood.",
						"But the Wood has also known sorrow. Not long after the founding of Alderheart, a massive forest fire known as \"The Great Calamity\" burned a portion of the Wood. The origins of the fire are unknown, but it left the area permanently damaged. To this day, it is called the \"Scorched Grove,\" an arid field of ash that has since become home to many strange flame-infused creatures.",
						"The Tenders, an organization of druids and mystics, dedicate themselves to healing the Scorched Grove with natural magics. Set up in conclaves around the Wood, they provide aid whenever forest fires strike. Yet, since the Grove's burning, the Wood has known relatively few fires. Nature's balance, though, can be disrupted by a single spark.",
						"Recently, fires have begun to rage through the Wood with a strength and fury not seen since ages past. Forest-dwellers are again being displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in Alderheart, and perch-dwellers are doing what they can to keep themselves safe up in their canopy sanctuaries. Relations between the humblefolk and birdfolk are tense. Moreover, a newly invigorated Bandit Coalition swells in numbers. Its sights are set upon Alderheart, where those displaced by the flames seek a means of survival.",
						"You are a citizen of the Wood, caught up in this turmoil. Or perhaps you are a storyteller from another world. Either way, the future of the Wood is yours to write. Within this book you will find all the tools you need to build your character, travel the land, and create your own Humblewood story.",
						"Whether or not Humblewood is able to survive the flames is up to you. Go forth and adventure! Only you can restore balance to the Wood."

								"The birdfolk races of Humblewood are as diverse and unique as the forest itself. Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as \"perches\") throughout the Wood. Despite regional differences and cultural peculiarities among the different kinds of birdfolk in the Wood, the birdfolk races nevertheless share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. This solidarity has allowed them to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age.",
								"While a diverse group, adapted for a variety of environments within the Wood, birdfolk also share several physical traits which have allowed them to find common ground in the construction of their perches. Beyond the obvious physical similarities, all birdfolk possess arms covered in feathers, which extend into wing-like appendages. While incapable of true powered flight, the strong hollow bones and lightweight bodies of birdfolk allow them to easily use their feathered arms to glide, and unless severely encumbered, all birdfolk can recover gracefully from what would otherwise be a deadly fall. In some birdfolk races these wings have grown strong enough to bear their owners upwards in a mighty flap, while others instead developed talons which make for both deadly defensive weapons and useful tools for scaling tall trees.",
								"The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart, and from this bastion of safety their ruling body, the Birdfolk Council, makes decisions which impact all of Humblewood. The birdfolk are well-defended from outside threats thanks to the Perch Guard, a force of soldiers trained in both aerial and ground combat, that keeps their cities and the denizens within safe.",
								"While Alderheart has been a beacon of peace and harmony for many years, the coming of the fires has thrown the region into chaos. The Perch Guard forces are spread thin across the canopy cities, barely able to secure the main roads for merchants while keeping their homes safe from the blazes. Now the great birdfolk cities face more threats from bandits and forest fires than ever before. Through it all, though, the birdfolk trust in solidarity, between themselves and the diverse groups of habitants who call their perches home, to weather the coming storm as they have so many times before.",

								"Not all denizens of Humblewood are birdfolk. The term \"humblefolk\" is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood's history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven't always seen eye to eye.",
								"Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the \"Humblefolk Treaty\" and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. The birdfolk offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted their offer. Over time, more and more humblefolk migrated to newly-established birdfolk perches, though many found birdfolk architecture to be restrictive for creatures without wings. In the same way, some groups of birdfolk, feeling too crowded within the booming perches, began to spread out and seek shelter within small woodland villages. Even today, the birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.",
								"After the establishment of the treaty, humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, although now in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous...until the fires came.",
								"With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified: those who found prosperity in the birdfolk cities have adopted a perch-dweller's perspective, while those who live in the woodlands face a constant threat from brigands and forest fires. Others have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment. Yet, where the treaty holds, vibrant humblefolk communities can still be found. The humblefolk are resilient, and each race will devise a way to survive in this dangerous wood.",

Similarly, raptors, a race whose physical characteristics resemble birds of prey, could reach around 5 feet in height. For the sake of simplicity we advise that, regardless of the physical measurements of a character, they follow the size category rules of their race (Medium or Small). In the lore, this can be expressed by saying that even a small strig is solid and strong, where even a taller raptor is light and agile. This will make calculating things that rely on size categories much easier, rather than having to remember which size variant a player has chosen for a race.",

				"In the beginning, there was only the sound of wings. Faint at first, the distant beats were easy to miss, but as time passed they grew stronger, faster, until they could be heard across the great unending dark. Then, with a single flap, creation burst forth: fire, ice, air, water, soil and sky, all came from the sound of feathers that resonated throughout the cosmos. This is the Great Rhythm, and by the Great Rhythm are all things moved. The Rhythm tells the sun when to set, and the moon when to rise. The Rhythm tells the seeds when to flower, the trees when to shed their leaves, and the snows when to fall. The essence of everything there is comes from the Great Rhythm. One day, the Rhythm may cue the end of creation\u2014but there will be no end to the Rhythm itself. As every downbeat has an upbeat to follow it, so too will the cycles of nature eventually start again\u2014for even though the Rhythm can be faint at times, it is everlasting and eternal.",
				"Every denizen of the forest, from the large to the small, from predator to prey, knows of The Great Rhythm: the beating force that is the pulse of life itself. To the birdfolk, the Rhythm began with the sound of beating wings, but other folk of the Wood tell that it began with the thundering of hooves, the padding of paws, or with a tiny heartbeat. Birdfolk believe that two great spirits emerged from the Rhythm. They were the first Amaranthine: Ardea, whose wings usher in the dawn, and Tyton, whose wings are the shadow of night. They are the avatars of life and death, and keepers of the Rhythm.",

								"With the birth of Ardea and Tyton, the world was set into motion. Where once there was nothing but barrens, the land came alive with the coming of the Amaranthine, and the world began its endless cycle of life and death. Their arrival split the formless sky into day and night. They created the sun and the moon, and the succession of light and dark which emerged from their movement across the heavens told all life when to act and when to rest. Ardea and Tyton were born from opposite parts of the Great Rhythm. Each knows of the other's existence, but they keep to their separate spheres, meeting only in the early hours of dawn and the late hours of dusk to exchange dominion over the sky. In seasons of warmth, Ardea has a greater reign over the sky, while in seasons of bitter cold, Tyton's power increases.",
								"The two Amaranthine created much of the life in Humblewood. Ardea suffused the days with sun-loving flowers, plants, and animals, while Tyton baptized the night with insects and animals that embrace the dark. They birthed sentient races, and from them originate all birdfolk, the first of their children, followed shortly after by the humblefolk.",
								"Originally, all birdfolk were the same. It was difficult to distinguish them from the birds of the forest, as they even possessed the ability to fly. One day, the entire flock of birdfolk decided on a grand contest of gift-giving, to prove which of them was the most worthy to lead. Ardea agreed to act as judge; whoever could present her with the greatest gift would become leaders among her children. For an entire season, birdfolk searched and scrounged, gathered and hunted, returning with trinkets, baubles, gifts great and small. Though Ardea commended all her children for their gifts, only five were truly deserving of her boon.",
								"Gesme, Reya, Hanera, Altus, and Clhuran: these five became leaders of the birdfolk. They inspired tales, devotion, and gave the birdfolk races their distinct forms and skills. These great ones went on to become part of the Great Rhythm as keepers of nature's balance and protectors of birdfolk across Everden, eventually ascending and joining the Amaranthine. The followers of each of the five were granted new forms and great gifts, to match their leader's exploits. Yet, to accept these gifts, something needed to be lost. This is why the birdfolk of today can only glide: their gift of flight was taken as the price for becoming something new."

								"The first to present Ardea with a worthy gift was Gesme, a clever birdfolk who saw potential in the world that her kin could scarcely imagine. She had observed the great orb of fire that Ardea had placed high in the sky, and how Ardea had positioned it a great distance from the land and its creatures, so it would warm them gently without burning them. But Gesme also saw that the sun vanished with the coming of night, when the creatures of the dark began to prowl, and thought: \"How remarkable would it be to have some of that fire in the world?\"",
								"Other birdfolk laughed at Gesme as she spent days plotting, and reading the sky. She examined every tree, from the great ash to the supple willow. Each day she carried a new branch in her beak, dropping many in frustration. The birdfolk were puzzled, but dismissed her actions. Then, one day at dawn, when the sun was at its lowest point in the sky, Gesme appeared with an oak branch in her beak. Without a word, she took off straight into the horizon. She flew for what seemed like ages, but the oak branch was light and did not trouble her. As she neared the sun her feathers, talons, and beak began to blacken in the heat. Still, she persisted. The oak was hardy and spry, and did not wither. Finally, she stuck the tip of the branch into the sun, igniting it. Hastily she flew back toward the ground, with the branch burning bright in her talons. The oak was patient, and did not burn up, keeping the flame steady as Gesme returned from the sky.",
								"\"See what I have brought here!\" she bragged, as the astounded birdfolk looked upon her scorched feathers. \"This will keep us warm on the cold days of winter, and safe through the long nights!\"",
								"Ardea was at first concerned at the presence of fire in the world, for she knew the forests could burn, and that misuse of the fire would bring harm to Everden. But, when she saw the birdfolk gather around the fires, and felt the gentle warmth a small flame could provide to her children, she was overcome with happiness.",
								"\"This,\" she declared, \"is worthy of a boon.\"",
								"And thus was Gesme changed. Set ablaze with the flames of knowledge and creativity, she became an Amaranthine. The forms of her followers changed too, and they became the first corvums. They were gifted with a bit of her cleverness and foresight, but Ardea gave them all black talons, feathers, and beaks as a reminder of the price Gesme paid to bring fire into the world."

Reya was capable and reliable, but birdfolk deemed her too independent to be a leader. She would travel the length and breadth of the land on her hunts, sometimes not returning for weeks at a time.",
								"During one of her journeys Reya encountered a stranger. The traveler's true form was hidden under a cloak, but they could fly and clearly felt as comfortable in the trees as any birdfolk. They had heard of Reya's skill in racing, hunting, and navigating the forest, and proposed three challenges, to which Reya agreed.",
								"For the first event, the pair moved to a patch of open sky overlooking rugged plains. There was a rocky outcropping in the distance; whoever flew there first would be the winner. The race began, and Reya immediately fell behind, the cloaked figure moving faster than Reya had ever seen.",
								"Reya summoned all her strength to keep up, beating her wings like never before. Yet the traveler kept inching forward, and she was unable to close the gap in time.",
								"Reya steeled herself for the next challenge. They flew to the meadows, where small creatures grazed, and it was decided that the first to catch five hares would be the winner. Reya moved with purpose, confident no one could best her skills with a bow, a tool of her own creation. Each of her shots found its mark, until she had but a single hare left to catch. But when Reya looked over at the traveler, she was shocked to see them waiting impatiently with a full complement.",
								"For the third and final event, the pair flew to the center of the forest. The first to emerge into the open fields beyond would be the victor. These were forests Reya knew well, and she was certain she would win. As soon as they had started though, Reya saw the traveler alight, darting through the trees as if weightless. Reya kept pace, using every trick she could to give herself an advantage. Still the traveler pulled ahead, if only by inches, and emerged victorious.",
								"Reya landed on a nearby branch and cursed her lack of skill. After a moment of pause however, she regained her composure, and thanked her competitor. Yet the traveler laughed, a sound so familiar, Reya wondered why she hadn't noticed before.",
								"\"You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.\" The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.",
								"It swirled, spinning a cloak out of the very clouds, which it placed around Reya. \"Consider this a gift, for providing me with such sport.\" Reya thanked the wind, and with that, it departed, caressing Reya's feathers in a familiar breeze.",
								"When the time came to present a gift, Reya offered Ardea her cloak of clouds, along with the story of her adventure. As Reya told her tale, Ardea could see the eyes of the other birdfolk light up with excitement. When Reya had finished, Ardea returned Reya's cloak to her, saying the story of her adventure was the rarer gift. Reya was changed, and became the Amaranthine of wind, archery, and exploration. Those she inspired became the first raptors. They began to take on a nomadic lifestyle, finding their fortune day by day as Reya once did and told tales of their own adventures by the light of the campfire."

								"The third to present a precious gift was Hanera, a gentle birdfolk and the first to shift her focus away from the sky. Rather than live in the trees with other birdfolk, Hanera made a home for herself below the canopy. She cared for the soil and the earth, and in return the earth gifted her with wisdom. From the earth, Hanera learned to speak with plants\u2014knowledge she used to better care for them. She soon earned fame among the birdfolk, as one who grew the largest and best-tasting crops.",
								"\"These crops,\" Hanera thought, \"are the finest gift I could offer to our Mother.\" And so she set about planting a large garden, its bounty reserved for Ardea.",
								"One day, while tending to her garden, Hanera saw a family of haggard travelers making their way out of the woods. When they saw Hanera, the mother begged her for aid.",
								"\"Please, kind sister, we are in great need. We were traveling through the forest when a creature attacked me and wounded my wing. We escaped, but I cannot fly. Please, help us, we are terribly hungry.\"",
								"Hanera knew that she couldn't feed herself and this family while storing crops for Ardea. Even still, she could not turn them away in their desperate state. She offered to share her home and her food for as long as the travelers needed, making sure their needs were met before saving any food for Ardea.",
								"The travelers stayed with Hanera for many nights while the mother healed. Each day, Hanera would prepare the family meals, telling the plants of their plight. The plants understood, and were honored to nourish the weary and wounded birdfolk. In return, Hanera ensured their seeds were saved and planted again, so their lives would continue indefinitely.",
								"At night, Hanera applied medicine to the mother's wound made from the leaves of kindly herbs. By the end of the season the mother had healed, the family was in good health, and they gratefully flew away.",
								"When the day finally came for birdfolk to present their gifts, all Hanera could offer Ardea was a few fruits and vegetables. She wove them together along with flowers she had grown, attempting to make her offering look more cheerful.",
								"\"I'm sorry, Mother Stork,\" Hanera said. \"I had meant to present you with a great harvest, but this is all I could provide.\"",
								"Ardea took the wreath, and spoke gladly: \"You have given me more than enough, for you see my child, I received your compassion for an entire season.\" As Ardea spoke, celestial messengers appeared by her side, and together they transformed into the birdfolk family Hanera had so tenderly cared for.",
								"For her charity, Hanera received the Amaranthine's boon: her feathers turned green and grew into vines and shoots, adorned with the most beautiful flowers. Other birdfolk stared in awe, and those who followed Hanera became the first gallus, blessed with her inspiring kindness, as well as her closeness with the earth and all growing things."

Altus felt pure joy when overcoming obstacles. He loved the cold seasons and challenged himself by hunting at night. His nocturnal existence granted Altus a perspective other birdfolk lacked.",
								"\"What if I gifted Ardea something she has never seen before?\" he thought. \"Yes! I shall hunt the moon, and present it to her, so that she may see its lovely glow.\" This would be unthinkable to any other birdfolk, but Altus was resolute, confident his gift would please Ardea.",
								"However, he was neither as skilled or nimble as Reya, nor as clever or cunning as Gesme. His arrows would not scratch the moon, and despite his great strength, he could not move it. But Altus was stubborn, for many nights he tried and failed to bring down his quarry. The more he tried, the more frustrated he became. Altus even thought he could hear the moon's laughter reflected in the babbling brooks and rippling ponds, mocking his futile efforts. Still, Altus remained determined.",
								"Tyton, intrigued, observed Altus as he struggled. \"Why do you persist in this task, my child?\" the Amaranthine of night asked. \"You must know you will not succeed.\"",
								"Altus replied, \"If I did not try, then I would never know for certain if I could. But you may be right. For all my strength, I can never best the moon, and only a fool refuses to acknowledge when he has been bested.\" Altus paused, letting out a sigh. \"Pity, it would have made a lovely gift for Ardea.\"",
								"Tyton was touched, not just by the sentiment but by the incredible will of this birdfolk.",
								"\"Your resolve does you credit\" Tyton said. \"To capture the moon, you will require this.\" He said producing a lidded chalice, intricately carved from the wood of an alder tree. Tyton gave it to Altus, then the Amaranthine of night disappeared.",
								"Altus was puzzled, until the moon appeared from behind a cloud. He heard its laughter in the pond behind him. When he turned, he saw it: the moon's reflection set perfectly in the still, clear waters. Without delay, Altus filled the chalice with water. With the moon clearly reflected within the chalice, he quickly shut the lid. The moon was caught.",
								"As dawn began to break over the horizon, Tyton appeared once again before Altus, \"Let my sister gaze upon my creation, but return it by day's end. The night has need of it,\" old Father Owl said, before departing for the lands beyond life.",
								"And so it was that Altus presented Ardea with the moon. He became the first strig, and his people were gifted with his great strength and indomitable will. He kept his oath to Tyton, returning the moon that very evening. For this, Tyton gifted all strigs with the ability to see clearly under its light. Tyton welcomed Altus as a guest in his home, deep within the lands of death. Altus found the cold there bracing, and decided to share it with the people of Everden. This is why the weather is so inclement in winter; Altus returns each year, carrying storms of sleet and snow in his chalice, to test the birdfolk's endurance."

Most saw him as little more than a bumbler, someone who floated their way through life. In truth, Clhuran was full of mirth and cunning. \"Where I am,\" he oft remarked, \"is simply where I am meant to be. I follow the flow of the universe.\"",
								"For all his mirth, Clhuran was notoriously fickle; he was a trickster, who delighted in humbling birdfolk who boasted about their cleverness. This earned him many admirers, and just as many enemies.",
								"Clhuran never intended to compete in the gift-giving contest.",
								"\"What should I care what others think of me,\" he harrumphed, \"So long as I am happy?\" Some birdfolk, bitter at having been fooled by him, claimed Clhuran could never hope to win such a contest. Clhuran tried to pay them no heed, in his heart he felt the barbs hit their mark.",
								"\"Who am I kidding,\" Clhuran sighed. \"I am not strong, nor smart, nor skilled, nor leaderly... I couldn't possibly produce a gift worthy of Ardea.\" With this last thought he sank into a bitter melancholy.",
								"It was only when a young boy approached him that he regained his confidence. \"Please Clhuran, won't you show us what you can do?\" the small birdfolk said. \"Many of us love your tricks, and your jokes. You bring joy to all birdfolk! Surely if you try you can do it!\"",
								"Clhuran saw the sincerity in the boy's eyes, and suddenly he knew what to do. \"Fine, fine,\" he exclaimed in mock annoyance. \"I suppose I shall entertain you.\"",
								"With newfound confidence, he approached Ardea. All of the birdfolk were gathered, and when Clhuran looked upon the crowd he saw both enemies and friends. Thoughts of those friendships allowed Clhuran to reach deep within himself, and from the depths of his soul he felt a beat, like the Great Rhythm itself. Channeling this energy, Clhuran opened his beak and brought forth a most beautiful gift: a song.",
								"It was a song so perfect, so harmonious, that no birdfolk could deny its charm. Ardea beamed. \"My child, you have within you a rare gift. May all of your kin be blessed by it.\" With those words, Clhuran became the first luma, the Amaranthine of all fortune, good or ill. His peculiar connection to fate is shared by all his kin.",
								"Ever since Clhuran's performance all birds sing, hoping that they might imitate the perfect song he sang to Ardea. While some sing pleasantly, Clhuran made it so those who mocked him can only trill, shriek, or caw artlessly. This is why it is always important to show respect for others, no matter how odd they may seem."

This process was considered deeply respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape it didn't agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as shapers, became mediators between the will of the people and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood\u2014Alderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart's branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart became Humblewood's capital. Known throughout the region as the \"Great Tree City,\" Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional and some from the farthest corners of Everden.",

Effectively everyone in Humblewood is connected to Alderheart.",

The majority of the city's inhabitants are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark alleys and back rooms.

								"As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.",
								"The canopy contains Alderheart's most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.",
								"City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are moni-tored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy. \"Branchroads\", specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding platforms provide birdfolk, at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps. Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital becomes increasingly dangerous.",
								"Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are stationed atop reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impres-sive homes are located in the Boughs District, just above the market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood and have a more modest feel to them.",
								"The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is stable floor beneath them.",
								"The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers. Pathways split and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.",
								"In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart's wood. They showcase unique wares and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is home to inns, taverns, and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train new recruits to their order.",
								"Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk market, the central support pillars contain tenement style housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out of the trunk, for Alderheart's traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since Alderheart was first shaped.",
								"Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind, illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood, most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that many cannot afford.",
								"The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are constantly on the lookout for smugglers.",
								"Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping, lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart: the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. These hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn't easy, but people are trying their best to keep their communities strong, as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the roots see it as necessary to survive."
