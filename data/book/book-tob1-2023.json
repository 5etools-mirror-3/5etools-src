A creature whose alignment is listed as \"unaligned\" is either created or controlled by another, such as a construct, or operates on more primal or instinctive behavior, such as a rat or tiger. Not every example of a particular creature exhibits behaviors consistent with the creature's listed alignment.

								"The world is full of monsters, and tabletop games teach us to face them\u2014and defeat them. There's a huge satisfaction in cutting a giant down to size or sending a malevolent dragon into a final dive from the heights. But what happens when we run out of monsters and the fear of them leaves us? What happens when the everyday {@creature Goblin||goblins} and dragons of our early years become overly familiar? Well, if you are Kobold Press, that's precisely the time to dream up new monsters.",
								"This new printing of our very first hardcover monster book for 5th Edition provides dungeon vermin and world-shaking villains, and it does so with a small refresh of these monsters and improvement of the volume as a whole. The wisdom of years of play shows we could tighten here and errata there. In some cases, our understanding of both monster rules and monster stats has evolved over time. It was time to address that.",
								"This 2023 edition also adds significant new art to strengthen the look and feel of these creatures, and it corrects several early errors and omissions, including the omission of reference tables of the monsters by Terrain and by Type. The Kobold Press team has also made lore changes; a {@creature Mithral Dragon Wyrmling|ToB1-2023|wyrmling version} of the mithral dragon is now available, along with an {@creature Ancient Cave Dragon|ToB1-2023|ancient version} of the cave dragon. Other new creatures include the {@creature planewatcher|ToB1-2023}, the {@creature Beheaded Vengeful Spirit|ToB1-2023|vengeful spirit}, and a couple others for you to discover. To make the makeover complete, we included rules material, like each monster's proficiency bonus, and we streamlined rules and game mechanics to improve the playability of many creatures.",
								"How did we find room in this compendium for new dragon stats, new tables, and new art? Well, several monsters are in-game gods or demi-gods, and they really don't belong here as dungeon foes (Boreas and Mammon, for instance). Others that we created in 2016 have since gotten rules and stats from Wizards of the Coast (the Zaratan and Titivullus, for instance). And some simply belong in a very particular world (for instance, the Emperor of the Ghouls is central to the Midgard setting). To avoid confusion, we dropped these creatures. Finally, a few monsters were simply not getting much play, and they have been released back into the wilds. In all cases, the changes strengthen an already powerful volume of monsters, cementing its status as a legendary reference book for 5th Edition games.",
								"Thanks to the continued play of tens of thousands of tabletop gamers, {@i Tome of Beasts} is back\u2014and fiercer than ever. So have at thee, beasts. This tome is ready to fuel great games and bring you true horrors and mayhem!"

From dastardly bandit lords to city watch captains to fiend-powered devilbound gnomes, these NPCs can be found across the world, breathing new life into the places they appear.

						"When an NPC's statistics include the note \"Humanoid (Any Race)\" as the creature type, you can adjust those statistics as described in the NPC Features table to create an NPC of the humanoid race detailed in the table. In this way, you can fill a city, town, or village with a particular humanoid type while still using variable statistics and differing challenges.",
						"To use the table, choose a set of NPC statistics, such as the {@creature bandit lord|ToB1-2023}, and reference the Race column for the humanoid you want to rework as that NPC. The Ability Modifiers column details how to change the ability scores in the NPC statistics, and the Features column lists which features from the chosen race you should add to the chosen NPC statistics. For example, a group of bandits might be led by a noctiny bandit lord seeking to build a small empire in honor of its patron. To create a noctiny bandit lord, use the statistics of the {@creature bandit lord|ToB1-2023} as the starting point. Increase the Charisma by 2 and the Strength by 1 and give it immunity to the {@condition frightened} condition. In addition, the bandit lord gains the Eldritch Fury attack and the Eldritch Weapons and Magic Resistance traits of the {@creature noctiny|ToB1-2023}.",
						"{@b NPC Features and CR}. Adding new traits and features to a creature's statistics can increase the creature's Challenge Rating. When adjusting statistics by using the NPC Features table, use the higher of the two CRs between the statistics you are adjusting and the lowest-CR version of the humanoid you are using. In the above example, the noctiny bandit lord's Challenge Rating is 4 (1,100 XP), as the {@creature bandit lord|ToB1-2023}'s CR is higher than the {@creature noctiny|ToB1-2023}'s CR.",
