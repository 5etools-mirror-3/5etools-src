						"Myths, fairy tales, folklore, and fantasy literature throughout the real world depict a tremendous range of giants. Some tales suggest that the humans of past ages were gigantic, and the relatively small stature of present-day humans is a mark of their degeneracy. Others imagine remote realms\u2014cloud castles or lost continents\u2014where Brobdingnagian people dwell, set apart from their puny relatives.",
						"In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, the story of the giants is a tragic one that echoes this whole range of fantasy and myth. Begotten by the mighty god Annam, who intended them to rule the worlds with wisdom as well as might, giants have fallen far short of the lofty destiny their progenitor imagined for them. Now supplanted by myriad smaller peoples of the worlds, giants live apart in remote steadings, undersea palaces, subterranean realms, and flying citadels.",
						"{@i Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants} explores giants' role in D&D and their realms across the worlds. It delves into the history of the giants and details the places where they live in isolation, as well as the ruins they left behind in their decline. Our guide in this exploration is the wizard Bigby, a former apprentice of Mordenkainen and creator of the spell {@spell Bigby's hand}. Though he began his career determined to use magic to dominate and control others, he eventually changed his ways and has worked hard to make amends for his past villainy. One factor that influenced his change of heart was Bigby's recurring encounters with Diancastra, a demigod revered by many giants. Throughout this book, we see glimpses into the relationship between these two mighty figures of legend.",
						"This introduction presents a portion of the saga of Diancastra. The saga is a window into important aspects of giants' life and thought, and it introduces themes that reappear throughout the book: Annam's retreat from his children, the giants' fall from grace, and the hope some giants hold for a future restoration of their ancient glory.",
						"{@book Chapter 1|BGG|1} introduces giant-themed options for adventurers, including a subclass that allows characters to tap into the magic of giants (the Path of the Giant barbarian), two giant-related backgrounds (the giant foundling and the rune carver), and a wide selection of feats. The chapter also includes roleplaying suggestions to help you connect a character of any class to the grandeur of giants.",
						"{@book Chapter 2|BGG|2} offers advice and tables to help Dungeon Masters use giants in play. It covers roleplaying tips, an overview of the hierarchical structure of the ordning and giants' religion, and ideas about giants' organizations and societies.",
						"{@book Chapter 3|BGG|3} presents tools to help Dungeon Masters build encounters, adventures, and whole campaigns around giants. The chapter includes tables you can use to populate the giants' enclaves presented in chapter 4.",
						"{@book Chapter 4|BGG|4} discusses the places where giants dwell: the remote enclaves and secret hideaways where they cling to the remnants of their ancient glory. Maps are a centerpiece of the chapter, presenting a range of sites steeped in giants' supernatural power that you can drop into any campaign.",
						"{@book Chapter 5|BGG|5} details the treasures characters might find as they deal with giants or explore giants' hidden realms. These treasures range from the contents of a wandering giant's bag to the mightiest relics of giants' ancient civilization. The chapter includes more than two dozen new magic items.",
						"{@book Chapter 6|BGG|6} provides stat blocks and lore for a tremendous variety of giants. The chapter includes new giant kinds (such as the {@book death giant|BGG|6|Death Giants}) and new variations on the giants found in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}.

						"The saga of the demigod Diancastra is an epic poem treasured by skalds and storytellers among all kinds of giants. The portion of the saga excerpted at the start of this book is among its most popular scenes, describing how Diancastra convinced her father to imbue her with divinity even though her mother was a mortal giant.",
						"The story is unusual among the sagas of the giants in its description of Annam's deeds \"in time's dawning.\" It boldly claims Annam collected the fragments of the First World\u2014the original world of the Material Plane, created by the primordial dragons Bahamut and Tiamat\u2014and contributed in some way to their transformation into the Material Plane as it exists today with its myriad worlds. Other sagas claim Annam was similarly instrumental in the creation of the Inner Planes, slowly sorting the tumult of the Elemental Chaos until the four Elemental Planes took shape. These sagas explain the giants' close ties to the elemental forces of air, earth, fire, and water by pointing to Annam's early efforts in the Elemental Planes.",
						"{@i Diancastra's Saga} also summarizes the central tragedy of giantkind's long history: Annam intended the giants to rule over all the worlds of the Material Plane, but his six sons\u2014the gods Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor\u2014failed to live up to their father's expectations for them. (Diancastra calls her brothers \"boorish and bumbling.\" Notably, Annam does not refute her on that point.) Annam's disappointment in his sons caused him to retreat to a hidden realm within the Outlands, far removed from the Material Plane and the domains of other gods.",
						"A key moment in {@i Diancastra's Saga} is Annam's challenge to his daughter. He dismisses her deeds as \"pranks and rebellion\" and defies Diancastra to bring him \"pure perfection,\" some item that for all his craft and skill he is unable to improve. He clearly intends this to be an impossible task.",
						"But Diancastra surprises him. Journeying to the outermost reaches of the Elemental Chaos, where unshaped elements form a tumult of matter and energy, she claims a mote of raw chaos and brings it to her father. Annam quickly shapes it, but he is unsatisfied with the result; he shapes it again and again, but\u2014as Diancastra points out\u2014each of his efforts to craft something from the chaos ends up reducing its raw potential into mere actuality.",
						"The saga makes a point that concerns more than Diancastra's cleverness. In granting his daughter's request for divinity, Annam acknowledges that the same chaotic, changeable potential exists within his sons and their descendants. Ultimately, this acknowledgment holds out the possibility that Annam's faith in his descendants might be restored and the All-Father might one day be drawn from his self-imposed exile. That glimmer of hope, faint as it might be, is a significant motivation for those giants who hope to reclaim their people's ancient glory, and it might account for the saga's popularity among giants of all kinds.",

Thus, the ordning neatly encompasses and arranges {@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}, {@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}, {@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}, {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, {@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}, and {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants} by connecting them to Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor, respectively.",

This book usually refers to \"creatures of the Giant type\" to make sure it's very clear what is being talked about. All the giants are creatures of the Giant type, as are {@creature Cyclops||cyclopes}, {@creature Ettin||ettins}, {@creature Fomorian||fomorians}, {@creature Ogre||ogres}, and {@creature Troll||trolls}.

Hill giants give their respect to larger and stronger giants without putting much thought into hierarchical ranks.

								"Some giants reject the ordning, in part or entirely. This rejection most commonly takes one of three forms.",
								"First are giants who hold themselves to a different standard than the one their kind traditionally values. These are often giants whose ranking within their kind is low. For example, a contemplative cloud giant might pursue knowledge rather than wealth, or a weak frost giant might trade in secrets and blackmail to hold onto some measure of power. These giants might avoid the company of their own kind to escape the expectations and customs attached to the ordning. In addition, devotees of Annam's daughters\u2014Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra\u2014tend to push against the strict definitions of the ordning as a matter of principle.",
								"Second, a few giants take a revolutionary stance meant to upset the ordning. A mighty frost giant warrior, not content to rule only frost giants and lesser creatures, could attempt to subjugate fire or cloud giants. Such revolutionaries often aim to impose their own kind's understanding of the ordning on all kinds of giants, so a master artisan among the fire giants might attempt to claim a higher place than storm giants who lack the same crafting skill. These efforts rarely have any lasting impact, but some have managed to upset the ordning at a local level for a few centuries. Because their sense of the ordning relies on physical power and military strength, frost giants are the most likely to impose their standards on other giants. Along similar lines, sometimes giants measure themselves by the standards of a different kind of giant and try to break from the ordning by exceeding those standards. A strong stone giant, for example, might try to claim a place within the frost giants' ordning.",
								"Third, giants who turn from the worship of Annam's children to other powers (as described under \"{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}\" later in this chapter) also reject the ordning. In some cases, as in the hierarchical cults of Elemental Evil, the new religion replaces the giants' ordning with a different structure that offers the same sense of order, purpose, and meaning. Such cults place giants at a higher position than the giants would otherwise enjoy in the ordning.",
								"When giants join the cults of demon lords, they reject the entire concept of the ordning\u2014the idea that there is any kind of order to the multiverse at all, which is the literal meaning of the word {@i ordning} in the Giant tongue. These giants reject meaning, status, and hierarchy in favor of chaos and destruction.",

In some of these stories, the ordning isn't natural at all; it's part of the giants' fall\u2014an invention of Annam's sons and a distortion of Annam's will for them. In other stories, it is a consequence of their fall\u2014a punishment Annam inflicted on the giants after they proved themselves incapable of governing the world. The ordning might be necessary, or a burden giants are expected to bear, but giants who hold these views often look forward to Annam abolishing the ordning in some mythic future.",
								"Giants on some worlds (including Eberron) have no concept of the ordning at all. Such giants might think of themselves as a single species, with the differences among giant kinds reflecting a cultural or geographical distinction rather than an inherent one. They might live in bands composed of multiple giant kinds or family groups of a single kind. Or giants of different kinds might not recognize each other as kindred at all.

Others believe he lost hope in his descendants when their ancient empires fell into ruin. Some claim he was weakened after a long battle against his brother, Memnor (who is more commonly described as one of Annam's sons), and was forced to withdraw from the world until he regained his strength. Other dubious tales suggest he fled the Material Plane to escape the consequences of some misadventure.",

										"{@b How do different kinds of giants live together?} The world might have a single empire of giants where giants hold ranks based on their position in the ordning. Or several smaller realms might coexist in varying degrees of mutual hostility. Maybe storm giants have their own realm or realms, cloud giants their domains, fire giants theirs, and so on. Or there might be different realms that all include multiple kinds of giants.",

Or maybe Humanoids are new arrivals on the world, and the first intrepid adventurers are trying to carve out a place for their peoples in a hostile world. Humanoids might enjoy comfortable positions in some realms (particularly those ruled by cloud or storm giants) and be subjugated or hunted in other realms. Humanoids might align themselves (voluntarily or otherwise) with different giant kinds, allowing the giants of the ordning to serve as patrons or adversaries.",
										"{@b What's the role of dragons?} In the Forgotten Realms and Eberron, ancient giants warred with dragons for control over the young world. Maybe in your setting, giants won a similar war, driving dragons into obscurity or even extinction. Perhaps such a war is still raging. Dragons might have their own realms alongside the nations of giants, coexisting in peace or in rising tension punctuated by occasional skirmishes. Alternatively, giants and dragons might have worked together to quash any opposition to their dominance over the world.",
										"{@b What's the role of the giants' gods?} With the giants ruling the world as Annam intended, perhaps the All-Father hasn't turned his back on his children. He might be a much more active deity here, and giants might be more engaged in his worship and service. Or perhaps the giants rebuilt their ancient empire with the help of other powers, such as Elemental Evils, demon lords, or the dragon gods."

Even for such long-lived creatures, twenty-five thousand years is a long time to hold a grudge. In your world, there might never have been conflict between giants and dragons, or they might have long ago set aside any lingering resentment. Perhaps giants and dragons banded together in ages past in a desperate effort to survive the rise of younger peoples. Or evil giants might have sided with chromatic dragons while good giants took up arms alongside metallic dragons in the long-running conflict between the children of Bahamut and the children of Tiamat.",

This enmity is visible most clearly in certain magic items originally made by dwarves to be highly effective against giants (and other creatures of the Giant type): the {@item dwarven thrower}, {@item Whelm}, and the {@item Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}. Often this history of conflict is assumed to be simply a matter of fighting over territory, since both dwarves and giants often prefer to live in mountainous regions. But the myths told by both giants and dwarves on some worlds describe the conflict extending into the divine realms as well. The god Moradin, who is revered by many dwarves, is said to loathe the evil giant gods. But you might decide the dwarves and giants of your world have a long history of friendly relations, or that dwarves often side with good giants in opposition to the schemes and depredations of evil giants. Perhaps dwarves are frequently the subjects of giant-ruled realms in the mountains, living peaceful and prosperous lives under beneficent storm giant rulers or toiling in poverty under fire giant tyrants.",

Perhaps in your world, elves and giants have coexisted peacefully in separate regions of the world. Or maybe they warred fiercely: an {@item elven thrower|BGG} (a spear that is otherwise identical to a {@item dwarven thrower} warhammer) might be a magic relic of those ancient battles.

										"The war might not be a simple two-sided conflict between giants and dragons. Perhaps elves, dwarves, good giants, and metallic dragons joined forces against a two-pronged assault from evil giants and chromatic dragons. Or war might be raging between dragons and elves while giants strive to protect smaller peoples from the fallout.",

										"The Thousand-Year War in the Forgotten Realms lasted a thousand years for good reason: neither giants nor dragons were ever particularly numerous, and actual skirmishes between giants and dragons were rare. For this reason, you could run a campaign where battles between the warring parties are isolated events along the lines of the world-shaking events described in \"{@book Campaign Events|BGG|3|Campaign Events}.\" You might begin the campaign with one such battle, have the adventurers spend months or even years dealing with the aftereffects of the cataclysmic battle, then send your campaign in a new direction with a second battle.
