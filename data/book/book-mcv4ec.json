				"Eldraine is a storybook world of quests and castles, knights and wizards, wicked warlocks and fantastical creatures. Once, valiant knights would venture from five royal courts to fulfill noble quests\u2014but the invasion of the horrific Phyrexians from another world changed all that and left the kingdom in ruins.",
				"The realm and the wilds of Eldraine were introduced to players of Magic: The Gathering with 2019's {@i Throne of Eldraine} set. The new {@i Wilds of Eldraine} set presents the world in the wake of the Phyrexian invasion, leaving behind the knights and castles and delving deep into the strange and mysterious wilds. Here, giants lumber through the clouds, faeries make mischief, and witches cackle over bubbling cauldrons.",

These humans include resilient and resourceful hunters, foresters, and artisans, and they often pick up some of the eccentricities of their more fantastical neighbors.

Seeing their homeland under attack inspired them to leave the woods and join the rest of Eldraine in its defense. Since the end of the invasion, the fauns have taken charge of the Tanglespan, a great chasm between the realm and the wilds. They map out the crisscrossing pathways spanning the chasm, fight off the {@creature Troll||trolls} who lurk beneath the bridges in hope of feasting on travelers, and guide travelers across the chasm in exchange for a modest toll."

In the wilds, {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants} have always been hostile to the rulers of the realm, even when elves governed the land. {@creature Cloud Giant||Cloud} and {@creature Storm Giant||storm giants} live far above the wilds on islands made of magical cloud. (See the {@creature tempest hart|MCV4EC} entry in this collection for more on Stormkeld and its giant inhabitants.) {@book Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants|BGG} includes many additional giant stat blocks as well as descriptions of other creatures that might be found in Stormkeld, such as {@creature Giant Goose|BGG|giant geese} and {@creature Giant Ox|BGG|giant oxen}."
