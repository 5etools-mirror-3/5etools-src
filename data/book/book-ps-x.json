						"This is a pretty special installment of the Plane Shift series for me, because I was the creative lead for Ixalan world building. Perhaps betraying my fourteen-year history working on {@style Dungeons & Dragons|small-caps;dnd-font}, Ixalan is a world of exploration and treasure, marked by ancient sites waiting to be explored by intrepid heroes. One of those sites, shown on a card in the {@i Ixalan} set, is obviously inspired by a classic D&D adventure, {@adventure The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan|TftYP-THSoT}. This plane lacks only dragons to be a fully realized D&D milieu\u2014there's even a world map!",
						"Ultimately, that means that writing {@i Plane Shift: Ixalan} was both a ton of fun and relatively easy. The people who populate Ixalan have a lot in common with D&D characters already, and mapping them to existing classes and backgrounds was a pretty straightforward task. Similarly, the creatures of the plane\u2014especially the dinosaurs\u2014had a lot of analogues in the game already. And still, this is the longest installment of Plane Shift yet!",
						"That's partly because I had the freedom to really cut loose on ideas and inspiration to help you play a character in this exciting world. You'll find more tables in here than ever before\u2014tables of personality traits and ideals to flesh out your character, of treasures to flavor your hoards, and inspiration to bring your party together. This sort of thing is both really enjoyable and really challenging to write\u2014a lot like the flavor text on Magic cards, actually, because each one is a self-contained nugget, a complete idea in a single sentence. I hope that all this stuff enriches your game.",
						"The appendix in this document is an extended musing on the colors of Magic and their relationship to D&D characters and spells. This is the sort of thing that dominates a lot of lunchtime conversations with members of the Magic creative team who are also avid D&D fans, and also the sort of thing I get a lot of questions about on Twitter. As with much of the rest of this document, the focus is more on roleplaying and character building than on rules. It's a first stab, though, toward a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the worlds of both games.",
						"As always, {@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering\u2014Ixalan} is the definitive resource for information about the plane. With this document, you can use that information to build a campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules, which you can {@link find here|https://dnd.wizards.com/what-is-dnd/basic-rules}. And even without the book, you can find lore about Ixalan on {@link the Magic web site|https://magic.wizards.com/}.",
						"There's a lot of open space on that map. I hope you have fun exploring the world of Ixalan!"

Its history has been shaped by the interaction between the Sun Empire and the River Heralds. Both peoples lived in balance while the Sun Empire maintained its stewardship of the Immortal Sun. But that balance was upset when the emperor abused the artifact's power. Now the Sun Empire has been pushed to the coastal lands of Ixalan, while the River Heralds dominate the interior.",

										"Many mages, especially Planeswalkers, routinely draw on two or more colors of mana. In some worlds, color pairs or triads have such a strong identity that they are manifested in the world. The guilds of Ravnica, for example, are each aligned to a specific pair of mana colors, and each of the clans of Tarkir used three colors. And some lands produce mana of more than one color, so that a highland lake might produce both red and blue mana. Mana pairs similarly suggest certain principles, create certain magical effects, and favor certain personality traits.",
										"Based on the color wheel, it's possible to speak of two colors of mana as either \"allied\" (adjacent to each other on the wheel) or \"enemy\" (separated by another color). White's allied colors are green and blue; its enemy colors are red and black. That doesn't mean that creatures associated with allied colors are necessarily on the same side of any conflict, or that creatures associated with enemy colors are actually enemies. But if conflict does arise\u2014for example, in a party of adventurers\u2014it's more likely to arise between a whitealigned and a red-aligned character than between a white-aligned and a blue-aligned one. That's the natural result of the different personalities and principles associated with each color. A white character might put a lot of stress on the value of law and order, and of working together toward a common goal. A red-aligned character values freedom and individuality."

										"In the language of the D&D game, the colors of mana are a means of categorizing the types of magic that suffuse all existence. When a spellcaster draws upon or manipulates the Weave (see {@book chapter 10 in the Player's Handbook|PHB|10}), part of that process involves tugging on a strand that connects to a land that produces mana of the desired color. Whether consciously or unconsciously, a druid casting {@spell barkskin} tugs on a strand of the Weave connected to a forest in the world, drawing out the green mana needed to cast the spell.",
										"There's no rules weight to this material; it's simply about roleplaying your character. If you're playing a cleric, you might find it helpful to imagine your character drawing on white mana, and you'll find that a lot of your spells could indeed be white spells in Magic. You might also find inspiration in the personality traits and ideals described in the white mana entry. But there's no rule preventing your character from using spells like {@spell divination} (a blue spell), {@spell stone shape} (a red spell), {@spell create undead} (a black spell), or {@spell insect plague} (a green spell). On the other hand, you might find that thinking about your cleric as a white-aligned caster shapes your choice of spells as well as your personality."
