While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.",
				"Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.",
				"As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.",
				"Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.",
				"The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.",

This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a {@spell fireball} in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}."

				"The Feywild Trinkets table that follows offers a selection of trinkets appropriate for Feywild-themed adventures such as this one. Players whose characters have the feylost or Witchlight hand background can roll on this table instead of the {@book Trinkets|PHB|5|Trinkets} table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to determine what trinkets their characters possess. The adventure includes a few encounters that require you to roll on the table to determine what random trinkets the characters find in key locations.",
