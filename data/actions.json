				"A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise\u2014such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell\u2014also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.",

Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher."
