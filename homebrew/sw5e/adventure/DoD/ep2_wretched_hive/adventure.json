Though Darga seems eager to show them a good time, he remains wary of outsiders, so he plans to keep the heroes close. As such, they must not only uncover the Hutt's involvement with the Sarlacc Project but also ingratiate themselves with Darga to gain his confidence.",
								"Five major events occur during the heroes' time in Darga's court, each of which can affect how the crime lord feels about them. Each event is considered a noncombat encounter that gives the heroes a chance to showcase their ingenuity and skills (though combat may well break out at any time). Each event has a primary challenge and one or more secondary challenges. To win the Hutt's favor, the heroes must succeed in the primary challenge of at least three of the five events. If they do so, the heroes gain XP as if they had defeated a CR 6 challenge. Additionally, they gain Advantage when making skill checks against Darga or any member of his organization except Igren Demos. Finally, the Hutt has {@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|TC-663} distribute datacards to the heroes that grant them access to a secret entrance to the guest quarters.

Some years ago, a smuggling ship in Darga's employ returned from the edges of the Unknown Regions with advanced droid interface technology. Instead of turning the technology over to scientists, Darga had his own technicians use it to create toys for his amusement.

The pilot then makes an attack roll for his droid (1d20 + the number of speed points wagered) against an AC of 13. Success indicates that the target droid is damaged by the attack; the attacking pilot gains a number of speed points equal to the number wagered, while the defending pilot loses that same number of speed points.

This is probably the event that the heroes have been waiting for, since it is their best chance to learn more about the secret project.",
								"When this event begins, three people are ushered into Darga's audience chamber: two men and one woman. Though none of them is wearing any kind of Imperial uniform, whispers of \"Imperial agents\" ripple through the court. The two men are dressed in basic laborer's clothing, and their eyes scan the room as if they expect an attack at any moment. The woman is also simply dressed, but it is clear from her bearing that she considers herself well above this assignment.",

Deals with the Empire have great potential rewards, he says, but one must always be careful when negotiating with such powerful allies. He implores the heroes to watch the proceedings and help him retain the upper hand in negotiations.",
										"If the heroes agree, the Hutt is very pleased, and he asks them to wait off to one side while he deals with the Imperial agent. When she arrives, flanked by her two guards, Darga rolls his eyes meaningfully in the heroes' direction and then greets the newcomers (\"Always a pleasure to serve the Empire! What can I do for you today?\"). Neither the agent nor her guards seem to notice the Hutt's glance toward the heroes.",
										"The Imperial liaison wastes no time and launches into a spiel about the transfer of Tibanna gas from Darga's holdings to the Empire. She insists that while Darga's supplies have been sufficient thus far, the Empire needs him to step up his production of refined Tibanna gas immediately. As the heroes should come to understand, Darga has been shipping the gas (which is used in producing blaster and turbolaser bolts) to the Empire in substantial quantities, and now they want more . The liaison offers the Hutt an 80% increase in payments for a 100% increase in output, claiming that it is more than fair since he will be making more money overall.",
										"Additionally, she makes two other propositions. First, the Empire is willing to offer a further 20% increase in payments if the Hutt accepts the increase in \"biological\" resources. Though she really means slaves, she does not come out and say so, and the heroes might not connect this statement with the complaints of the Iron Ring slavers. (It's fine if they don't; the full extent of the sordid deal will be exposed in the next adventure, {@adventure The Queen of Air and Darkness|orcnogDoDEp3} .)",
										"Second, the liaison offers to provide Darga with a personal Imperial security retinue as a sign of their continued good faith. The Hutt would have an Imperial regiment stationed in the city of Zarra, and a flight of Imperial starfighters would escort him when traveling off-world.",
										"At this point, Darga turns to the heroes for advice. If the heroes have not set up a private method of communicating with the Hutt, Darga dismisses the Imperials temporarily so they won't overhear the discussion. If the heroes provide him with the advice he wants to hear, they can earn his favor. Of the three proposals, Darga believes that the first one is sound (more money coming in at only a slight discount) and the latter two are not. The slaves he has been getting from the Empire are used up, and payments in credits are more reliable in the long run. Additionally, the promised security retinue seems like little more than a plot to expand Imperial influence on Cato Neimoidia and keep the Hutt under the Imperial Security Bureau's watchful eye.",
										"If the heroes make the correct recommendation (\"yes\" on the increased production, \"no\" on the increased payment in biological resources, and \"no\" on the Imperial retinue) for two out of the three options, Darga is suitably impressed by their keen minds, and they will have gained more favor with the crime lord."

She has been spying on Organa for several months now, though she has been unable to uncover hard evidence of his involvement in treasonous activities. She was called away from her assignment to assist the Empire in continuing their arrangement with Darga the Hutt, and she was not expecting to run into anyone who might recognize her.",

Mentally, she notes the faces (and names, if possible) of the heroes and vows to ensure that the Empire becomes aware of their activities. If the heroes allow Sinde to leave after such an exchange, she might become a thorn in their side down the road, particularly if they journey to worlds under tight Imperial control, such as Coruscant or Nizon. Though such repercussions are beyond the scope of this adventure, feel free to have Sinde show up later.",

The Empire approached Darga a few months ago with an interest in obtaining some of his Tibanna gas supplies off the record\u2014though Gome recalls that they threatened to bring down the Hutt's crime syndicate if he didn't play nicely. Since then, Darga has been funneling every canister of Tibanna gas to the Empire for a secret project. The gas, which is refined on the planet Bespin, is loaded into large starships and handed over to the Empire in the space above that world. In return, Darga receives some kind of goods (Gome does not know what), and their transaction is ended.

								"When he is certain they are alone, {@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|TC-663} (who insists that the heroes call him Six Six) explains that in addition to serving as the Hutt's translator, he also serves another master\u2014a droid crime lord named Switch, who lives on Sel Zonn Station above the world of Brentaal. If the heroes played through {@i {@adventure The Traitor's Gambit|orcnogDoDEp1}}, they have probably already encountered Switch and perhaps even offered to act as his agents in the field.",
								"{@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|Six Six} reveals that he has come to convey a small piece of information on Switch's behalf. The droid tells the heroes that he has been monitoring communications leaving Darga's palace, and it seems that someone has been transmitting information to the Empire while the Hutt sleeps, receiving instructions in return.",
								"{@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|Six Six} has been sending these messages on to Switch, but the droid crime lord has been unable to break their encryption. Switch has ordered Six Six to turn the encrypted transmissions file over to the heroes and see what they can make of it. If the heroes are willing to share their findings with {@creature 3PO Series Protocol Droid|orcnogSW5e|Six Six} (who will share them with Switch), they can have the file at no charge.",
								"Any hero who makes a successful DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Technology}) check decrypts the file and retrieves the contents of the message. It reveals that late at night, the Hutt's majordomo, Igren Demos, has been contacting an Imperial communications relay somewhere in the sector. The heroes cannot be certain who he is communicating with, but they know that Demos has been transmitting information about Darga's dealings\u2014particularly his slave trading\u2014on a regular basis. The most recent communication specifically mentions that the slavers that Darga has been dealing with are unhappy with their merchandise. Additionally, several messages mention \"the prisoner\" but provide no further details.",
								"If confronted about his communications with the Empire, Igren Demos staunchly denies it. Presenting the decrypted file does not help because Demos claims that it must be a forgery, and Darga is inclined to agree with his trusted advisor. If the heroes remain adamant that the majordomo is doing something untoward even after Darga dismissed this claim, the Hutt might become upset. To represent his shifting attitudes, you might wish to treat a previous incident in which the heroes successfully curried Darga's favor as a failure instead."

								"One of the most critical events that happens during the heroes' stay in Darga's palace is their discovery of a comatose Jedi Master named Denia. This event should occur only near the end of their stay in the palace, and most likely after the heroes have gone through the five events in Darga's court (and perhaps obtained the datacard granting access to the guest quarters). Since the discovery of Denia will probably conclude the heroes' time in Darga's palace, do not rush in introducing this event.",
								"During the Clone Wars, Denia was fighting on Cato Neimoidia when she was injured in an explosion. One of the Separatist generals had her unconscious form brought to this palace and placed in an artificial coma while they decided what to do with her. When the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end, the Separatists fled the palace and left the Jedi behind. Darga moved in soon after and discovered Denia's comatose body. Never one to throw away a potential resource, Darga had her moved to the lowest levels of the palace and kept unconscious, thinking that there might come a day when she could prove useful. When the heroes arrived, Denia could sense their presence even while unconscious (either because one or more of the heroes is Force sensitive, or because destiny swirls about them), and she reaches out to them for help.",
								"This first becomes apparent when the heroes (particularly any Force-sensitive heroes) start hearing whispers in their heads. If the heroes stay in Darga's palace after their time in his court, one or two of them begin to hear whispers in their sleep, so strongly that they awaken. If the heroes appear to be making plans to leave, you can have them hear the whispers while awake. The voice, clearly that of a woman, says things such as, \"Help me,\" and \"I know you can hear me.\" If the heroes attempt to ignore the whispers, the voice becomes more insistent, begging for help and pleading with them to find her.",
								"If the heroes search for a way to find the whispers, they discover that the voice becomes stronger if they descend through the guest quarters into the lower reaches of the palace. If the heroes curried Darga's favor and were given the datacard to access the secret way in and out of the guest quarters, they can also use it to access a turbolift to the lower levels of the guest quarters. The turbolift leads them directly to the chambers where Denia is being held.",
								"If the heroes never obtained the datacard, they can still reach Denia by finding a stairwell that leads down into the lower guest quarters. However, this path passes through an antechamber where some of Darga's Gamorrean guards await. The guards tell the heroes to turn back, and if they refuse, a fight ensues."

If he thinks it will cause the heroes to spare his life, Demos reveals that Darga has fled to Cloud City, but not even the majordomo knows the exact location of the Hutt's safe house there."
