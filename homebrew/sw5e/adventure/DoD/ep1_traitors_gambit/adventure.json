								"The {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign opens some months after the rise of the Empire, with the Clone Wars a very recent and vivid memory for most beings in the galaxy. The Empire has begun tightening its grip on star systems throughout the galaxy, and Darth Vader stands at the newly declared Emperor's right hand, crushing any opposition and hunting down the last remnants of the Jedi Order. In these short months since the fall of the Republic, many have joined the Empire willingly, including the Core Worlds whose Human nobles stand to benefit a great deal from its tyranny. Similarly, many others have begun rebelling against Imperial oppression, finding themselves driven out of their homes (or worse) and forced to live in a galaxy that tolerates no opposition to the Empire. Throughout the {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign, the heroes must deal with the reality that the Empire is a monolithic threat without any kind of organized opposition, and dealing with agents of the Empire can be dangerous.",
								"Despite the difficulties the heroes face in terms of Imperial dominance, they are in a unique position to deal the first significant blow against the Empire. In the first adventure, the heroes will come face to face with the man who will become their clandestine benefactor, Senator Bail Organa. In the new Empire, seditious acts are punished harshly, and as such the heroes will find that they must be extremely cautious in their actions. With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, the heroes of the {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign may find that a one-way trip to Kessel is the best they can hope for if they fall into the hands of the Empire.",
								"The first act of the campaign (comprised of the first three adventures \u2014 {@i The Traitor's Gambit}, {@i {@adventure A Wretched Hive|orcnogDoDEp2}}, and {@i {@adventure The Queen of Air and Darkness|orcnogDoDEp3}}) introduces the heroes to one another and to some of the key figures in the campaign. Over the course of the first arc, the heroes discover that the Empire has a secret project in the works that could have dire consequences for the galaxy if it comes to fruition. Thanks to the help of former Imperial Admiral Gilder Varth, whom the heroes should rescue at the conclusion to the first adventure, the heroes learn that the Empire's secret project has left a trail of money and slaves that they can follow to find the truth. During the first three adventures, the heroes travel to famous planets such as Alderaan, Bespin, Cato Neimoidia, and Felucia, fighting Imperial stormtroopers, destroying secret labs and prisons, encountering vile Hutt gangsters, and participating in a dangerous sabacc tournament where the buy-in might be more than they can afford. The first adventure, The Traitor's Gambit, is relatively straightforward, allowing the heroes to become accustomed to one another and the SW5e rules. Each subsequent adventure leads the heroes down new paths and introduces different playstyles.",
								"Certain kinds of heroes will find it easier than others to flourish in the {@b Dawn of Defiance} campaign. First and foremost, the heroes should view the Empire as both a threat and an enemy. As the major villainous entity of the campaign, the Empire represents something that is to be feared and loathed, and characters with Imperial sympathies will likely find themselves in conflict with the overarching plot. Otherwise, the heroes can come from almost any background and profession. As long as they are willing to fight against the Empire (both covertly and openly), they should find the campaign engaging and exciting. Not every hero needs to be an idealistic freedom fighter; smugglers, bounty hunters, and free traders have just as much to gain from weakening the Empire as rebellious troops do. If the heroes' motivation is personal profit or increasing their own power, they could do worse than to work for Bail Organa. Not only is he rich, but he is also powerful and influential, and his influence could very easily be transferred to any heroes that get on his good side."

Based on this information, the heroes are hired (as friends of Bail Organa, enemies of the Empire, or freelance entrepreneurs) to fly to the planet Felucia and discover the fate of a turncoat Imperial Admiral.

The heroes fight their way through the facility and eventually find Admiral Varth in the detention block.

Once they reach the roof, they board Okeefe's ship and blast off from Felucia.",

There, the heroes are introduced to the Nebulon-B frigate {@i Resurgence}, which has been commissioned by Organa to serve as a mobile hiding place for the Admiral.

In addition to stormtroopers and Imperial officers, Brentaal's planetary security force keeps a watchful eye on everything that happens on Sel Zonn Station. The planetary security force gets along well enough with the Empire, though questions of jurisdiction have caused tension between the two in the past. For the most part, the planetary security force operates out of the local security office, where it keeps a number of cells open for criminals and malcontents. Those captured by the Empire, however, are incarcerated in the security office briefly before being transported via shuttle to the planet's surface. Customs enforcement is relatively light simply because large cargo haulers cannot dock with the station. As such, usually only a single customs officer is on hand for any cargo inspection.",

Filled with shops of all kinds, as well as large, open seating areas with fountains, plants, and other decorations, the Promenade is where Brentaal's nobles and other station visitors go to enjoy themselves. Security is tight on the Promenade, and Imperial forces are on hand at all times to keep the peace. Additionally, the Empire tries to keep the area free of aliens, and as such they harass any non-Humans moving about the Promenade. Although they won't go so far as to arrest anyone, they often try to start fights with aliens just to have an excuse to lock them up. For this reason, most non-Humans tend to stay clear of the Promenade, except on rare occasions."
