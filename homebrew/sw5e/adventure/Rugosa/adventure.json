					"One of several precursors to the AT-ST walker, the AT-RT was 3.2 meters tall and 2.9 meters long, with a saddle-like seat for a single clone trooper driver. Its open cockpit design made the driver especially vulnerable to sniper fire, a notable flaw, but low costs and good visibility of the battlefield made up for this shortcoming. While other walkers like the AT-PT eliminated the flaw of the exposed driver position, the AT-PT was slower, and this made the AT-RT competitive with the former as it was capable of tremendous speeds and could also leap quite a distance thanks to its light construction.",
					"The recon walker was equipped with a nose-mounted repeating blaster cannon and mortar launcher, both of which made the walker a formidable anti-infantry unit, although a group of five walkers could easily overpower a single AAT. The AT-RT was fitted with a motion detection scanner and sensor equipment capable of providing Forward Command Centers with updated situation reports from the battlefield.",
					"AT-RTs could be deployed to the battle field in various ways. They were usually deployed from landed Acclamator-class assault ship, but this wasn't always practical for size reasons. When this occurred, they could be deployed by LAAT/is, 1 per gunship stored on the speeder bike ramp, 2 could be carried if the crew bay was empty.",
					"The walkers could also be deployed from modified AT-TEs with special cargo lifts in their back section. They could transport 2 Walkers and their riders. ARF Troopers were known to pilot these walkers."
