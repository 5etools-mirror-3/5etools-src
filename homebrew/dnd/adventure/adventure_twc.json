After being attacked by the goblin, on the Rogue's turn, she uses her reaction to roll a DEX save against the goblin's scimitar attack, then use her first action to drop her dagger in order to grasp her rapier with two hands, increasing the damage die.}",
							"{@b Then for her second action, she moves away from the goblin and toward the wolf, a total of 15 ft. of movement, and then she attacks. On her d20, the player rolls a 17 for her attack, and the DM says \"Nice!  17 plus your +3 DEX ability modifier makes that a 20, which totally beats the wolf's DC. Hey, in fact that's a 20, so it's a critical hit!\"}",
							"{@b The player then rolls for damage, and she and the DM add it up, the DM announcing the details: \"Okay, for your 1d10 versatile weapon damage you rolled 9, and then your proficiency bonus gives you a +2 modifier.  So that's 11, tripled for the crit becomes 33. Are you also going to use your Sneak Attack?  Ok great, so for your 3d6 sneak attack damage, you rolled 19... so that all comes out to a total of... 52 slashing damage.  Unbelievable! How do you wanna do it?!\"}",
							"{@footnote ANSWER|Answer: 20 Possible Errors (at least that I know of)...<br/><br/>1. Rolling a DEX Save is not a reaction, and it's usually not part of your turn either.  It's only ever done in response to some other trigger.<br/><br/>2. A goblin's scimitar attack does not require a DEX save. Also, resolving whether the goblin hit or not would have already happened before the Rogue's turn.<br/><br/>2. You only get one action per turn. Some classes may get two attacks per action, but actually rogues don't!<br/><br/>3. Dropping something in your hands (like a dagger) is not an action. It's considered a \"free object interaction\".<br/><br/>4. Rapiers are not versatile, meaning that grasping them with two hands does nothing to increase the damage.<br/><br/>5. Moving is part of the Rogue's \"movement\",  not technically part of her action, as the text described it.<br/><br/>6. The goblin gets an attack of opportunity if the Rogue moves 15 ft. If the goblin just attacked her with a scimitar, the Rogue is certainly within its reach, and moving 15 ft in any direction means she's leaving its reach.<br/><br/>7. She should have rolled with advantage. The wolf was prone and she was making a meleé attack. In fact, having advantage is the only reason Sneak Attack applies here. Without advantage, she shouldn't have presumed that she could use Sneak Attack in the first place. Hypothetically.<br/><br/>8. The DM forgot to add the Rogue's proficiency bonus to the attack roll. The attack roll modifiers on a non-crit include ability modifier and proficiency.<br/><br/>9. The DM said the attack roll beat the monster's \"DC\"... should have said \"AC\" (meaning \"armor class\").<br/><br/>10. The DM announced that it was a \"critical hit\", which it isn't. Only a rolled natural 20 is a crit (unless you have some additional class feature like the \"Improved Critical\" feature of a Champion archetype fighter).<br/><br/>11. Rapiers do 1d8 damage, not 1d12. Again, a rapier is not a \"versatile\" weapon, so its damage roll remains 1d8, even when wielded with two hands.<br/><br/>13. Proficiency bonus is not added to weapon damage. It is added to attack rolls, but not damage rolls.<br/><br/>14. The proficiency bonus for a Level 5 character would be +3. Assuming she's a 5th level character, proficiency should not be +2, as the DM stated.<br/><br/>15. Ability modifier should have been added to the weapon damage (e.g. +3 DEX modifier). Since a rapier is a \"finesse\" weapon, either the DEX or STR ability can be used, so unless the player had a +0 to both DEX and STR (which they didn't, according to what the DM said earlier in the paragraph), they forgot to add this.<br/><br/>16. Hypothetically,  damage on a critical hit is doubled, not tripled. Had this been a real crit, they seemingly would have messed that up too.<br/><br/>17. Hypothetically, damage modifiers are not multiplied on a crit. Damage modifiers are added only after the attack damage is doubled.<br/><br/>18. Hypothetically, the 3d6 Sneak Attack damage mathematically couldn't have been above 18. The DM said it was. Not really a RULE gaff, but still an obvious mathematical error.<br/><br/>19. Hypothetically, Sneak Attack damage is doubled on a crit.  To be clear, this attack was not a critical hit, but if it had been, the Sneak Attack dice, which are part of the attack damage, should have been double along with the weapon damage.<br/><br/>20. A rapier does piercing damage, not slashing damage.<br/><br/>21. Rogues can't be girls (yeah just kidding)|Answer} (hold shift and hover to lock pop-up in place)"

I've acquired many treasures during my lengthy adventuring career,\" says Madryck. \"but none as marvelous as the one I accquired from a legendary magic merchant. His magic shop, whose name I shall not utter, is not easily found, and his wares do not come cheap.  For I was only able to acquire my prize by bartering for it. The item was tarnished brass framed spectacle, unassuming in appearance, but it granted the wearer the ability to find what they were looking for, be it lost items, clues, or even hidden treasures. The asking price was well beyond my means, so I struck a deal: in exchange for this spectacle, I traded 38 years of my life. At the budding young age of 20, it seemed like a fair deal at the time. But now look at me. Nearing death. I look and feel all of 90, when I'm actually in my 50's. I gambled away my twilight years for a parlor trick trinket that I've now... [sigh]... lost.  Yes, it's true.  It was a magic item that literally finds other items, making it the only object in my posession that I could {@i possibly lose}... Oh the terrible irony.  And now I am left with such regret over my foolish trade, I cannot stand it.\" [Hacking cough]",

Take this and try to sell it to the shop keeper in exchange for as many years of my life as he'll trade back. It's not much but since losing my spectacle, I've slowly had to sell off my treasures, and this ring is now all I have to trade.\"",

The wearer can speak with birds and beasts, and gains influence over them when needed.\" He forces a smile, \"In the right hands it really could be quite powerful!\" he says enthusiastically, doing his best to promote the ring's worth. \"Please convince the shop keep of its considerable value.\"",

It exists in a pocket dimension between planes, and can only be accessed one way: Every eight years, our world is visited by a traveling extravaganza called the Witchlight Carnival, and hidden somewhere in the carnival is a doorway to the magic shop. The exact location of this portal changes constantly, but rest assured that {@i someone} always knows where it is.  The Carnival has recently returned to this world and is camped closeby, just outside of Phandalin.

Your boot meets a stone floor on the other side, and you lean through the yawning portal, the rest of your party following. Leaving the crisp night air of the carnival, your face is greeted with a flood of warmth and the smell of inscense. The sudden temperature change makes you want to shed a layer or two. As the last of your party steps out of the swirling portal, it shrinks behind you with a shlurping sound like the last few drops of a milkshake being sucked up through a straw.",
										"Upon immediate entry, you can see a series of ever-burning candles in sconces adorning the walls, each one burning a slightly different color, all of them flickering like there's wind when there's none.  Inside the chamber you can see shelves that have several small trinkets laid out, including a jar of buzzing bees, various rings, a bedazzled comb with the \"Kirkland\" brand name stamped on it, and high atop one shelf, a long blade that seems to ooze a black ichor. It looks simultaneously powerful and hideous. And many other items. In the back behind a desk there appear to be more shelves with books and books and more books. You see only one figure in the room, standing behind the desk, who turns around to make your appearance. You see a large, seven-foot tall humanoid figure. His short, smooth, fine orange fur puffs up a little bit as his eyes meet yours. You can also now see he's holding a cat-like critter with wings, stroking it's head as it purs. The figure's physicality is slightly hunched and there's just a big ol' smile on the face.",

										"{@b Why did you set up shop in a pocket dimension?}: Security mainly. Pretty hard to steal from a place you can't find. And I've got plenty worth stealing.",
										"{@b Who else works here?}: Just me! And little Pocket here.",
										"{@b What is this creature called?}: Oh, Pocket?  She's a tressym from the northern city of Everlund. Adorable little kitty isn't she?",
										"{@b So, is there a {@i Mrs.} Garfield the Deals Warlock?}: Married to my work, you might say!  Although Pocket here bosses me around enough that I may as well be {@i pussy-whipped}! [chuckles cheesily]",
										"{@b How do you know the carnival owners?}: Oh we go way back!  I myself used to be a Witchlight Hand (one of the carnival workers).  Then I graduated to more serious matters and found my niche: making {@i deeeeeals!} And after a while, once I started really dealing in powerful items, I had to limit admittence to my shop. {@creature Mister Witch|TWC|Mr. Witch} and {@creature Mister Light|TWC|Mr. Light} offered me a reliable way to do so.  Isn't it a fun way to screen my customers?!",

										"{@b Okay, I hear you like to make deals? What's the most unusual deal you've made?}: Oh quite, yes! Only the very rich could afford most of my wares. But I do so love to take other forms of payment! The most interesting deal would have to be that one very charming young lad who offered to buy one of {@footnote my trinkets|If they must know, the trinket was an alchemy jug. Yeah the young man was a BIG fan of mayonaisse. Pretty gross.} with what he called \"his very Charisma\". He's a surly grump of a hermit these days, while I'm quite enjoying using his charasmatic talents as my own!",
										"{@b Can we BUY stats? Like XP?}: Hell to the nah.  Garfield collects them for himself.  He does not sell them!",
										"{@b Here's our quest... Will you come fight with us?}: Hmm, I think not! If I joined every adventuring band of heroes that tried to recruit me, I wouldn't be around long. Nope, Garfield intends to stay put, make a profit, and keep collecting my marvelous trasures.",
										"{@b What are you planning to do with all this stuff, if not use it?}: Oh the baubles and trinkets of my shop may not be of much use to me here in my little pocket realm, but it's a means to acquire more precious things. I've scraped together enough years of life from destitute customers, for instance, that I shall live for hundreds more years before I even need to think about bargaining for more."
