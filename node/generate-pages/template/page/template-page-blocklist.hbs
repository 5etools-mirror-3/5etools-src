			This page allows you to create configurations which &quot;blocklist&quot; site content, hiding it from list pages.
			This can be used, for example, in conjunction with homebrew content, to create a campaign JSON file containing additions to the base game,
			as well as the removal of extraneous content.

			With great power comes great responsibility. If you are a DM intending to use this system to remove parts of the game you
			consider broken; inconvenient; or otherwise in need of adjustment, please first consider the needs and expectations of your players,
